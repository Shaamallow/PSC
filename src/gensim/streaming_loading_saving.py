# Count each relevant word, uses his ID and give a vector of the couple : (wordID, count in doc)

# Market Matrix Formatting a corpus

corpus = [[(1, 0.5)], []]  # make one document empty, for the heck of it

# SAVE CORPUS

# Load corpus 

corpus2 = gm.corpora.MmCorpus('/tmp/corpus.mm')

# Corpus is a stream to avoid overloading RAM :

# 1st Method : load everything in RAM ...
print(list(corpus2))

# 2nd Method : Use stream interface 
for doc in corpus2:
    print(doc)
