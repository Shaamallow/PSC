sector plans independent review committee what are we going to do key points in this strategic agenda changes of direction goals for the present government term of office what are we going to do steps after the present government term of office financial section references abbreviations foreword to the top together the government wishes to equip the netherlands for position in the vanguard of the knowledge economies the triangle of research education and entrepreneurship is the foundation of our prosperity it is enterprising top scientists innovative entrepreneurs with long term view and passionate teachers and students who constitute the basis thereof cross pollination between these groups strengthens the earning capacity and economic growth potential of the netherlands and helps to resolve the big social issues of today and tomorrow the earning capacity of dutch society is highly dependent on our international position that is why the government is striving for higher education system with international allure world class research that attracts scientific top talent and reinforcement of the international position of the business community by reinforcing the top sectors and our export position while providing an excellent climate for innovation and establishing business to provide sufficient room for initiative and creativity the government is making number of choices in education innovation and economic policy the in these choices is that entrepreneurs researchers teachers and students are increasingly challenged to excel they will have more room to make their own choices they are encouraged to invest in their strengths and have the courage to specialise and thus make choice thus fewer separate programmes fewer subsidy arrangements imposed from above less bureaucratic red tape fewer administrative burdens and more direct responsibility for the people and organisations that make and shape progress in this way the government wishes to create the conditions in which both entrepreneurship and science can achieve top performances each with their own dynamics but more and more together with and nourished by excellent higher education trade and industry policy as well as policy for higher education and science is based on this principle as expressed in the government response to the advisory report by the committee and the trade industry memorandum earlier this year the government is taking clear steps and making clear choices they are large steps and often the first steps on the road to genuinely different way of working this will occur with the measures in this strategic agenda for higher education research and science and with those in the trade industry memorandum that will follow before prinsjesdag the official opening of parliament in september this strategic agenda for higher education research and science particularly concerns the quality of education profiling and the of institutions and collaboration in the triangle of education research and entrepreneurship agreements will be made with the institutions in this respect in this way they are increasingly held to account for their responsibility regarding socially desirable performances the following measures in the agenda are the nucleus for this the government is investing an amount increasing to million to boost the quality of higher education the savings from the study completion delay measure and the implementation of the social lending system in the master phase will be for this fundamental change in direction in the financing of higher education will be implemented growing proportion of the funding will be earmarked for quality and profiling collective and individual performance agreements will be made with the universities regarding quality profiling and valorisation these must result in reduction of the number of education programmes on offer reinforcement of the relevancy of the programmes available for the labour market the development of focus areas in research and enhancement of the impact of research the bar will be raised in higher education the legislation and regulations will be modified to measures to assure degree quality study success education quality and intensity selection differentiation in the programmes available and funding higher education research and science powerfully support the top sectors approach of this government the valorisation task of the institutions will be better assured with these measures the government has changed direction reflecting the outlined points of departure this involves taking steps to make higher education future proof such change cannot be achieved overnight it needs time and requires this course to be maintained for many years this cannot be imposed from above but must grow from within and requires the efforts of all those involved in and around higher education in order to make rapid progress my next step will be to conclude outline agreements with the universities of applied sciences and research universities this autumn in his memorandum on trade and industry policy the minister of economic affairs agriculture and innovation has announced that he will further develop the ideas resulting from the recommendations of the top sectors the promotion of enterprise and innovation through generic fiscal facility for in corporation tax simplification of regulatory measures and an sme plus innovation fund the reinforcement of public private partnerships in which companies knowledge institutions and the government on the one hand use collective resources in the framework of knowledge and research programmes for example in the form of top technological institutions and on the other hand collectively promote the alignment of education and the labour market for example in the form of centres of expertise furthermore in this memorandum the minister will also provide clarification about the manner in which the remaining financial resources will end up with the best projects and the cross pollination between fundamental research and innovative entrepreneurship will be reinforced together these two memos form the basis for the direction in which the government wishes to go entrepreneurs researchers teachers and students will receive more room to make their own choices they will be challenged and encouraged to invest in their strengths to have the courage to specialise and thus to choose this is how we work on excellence the state secretary for education culture and science halbe zijlstra the minister of economic affairs agriculture and innovation verhagen introduction this strategic agenda quality in diversity outlines long term perspective for higher education research and science top sectors approach our aim is future sustainable higher education system system with international allure in which students are with the top sectors approach the government challenged teachers teach with enthusiasm and researchers wishes to increase the competitive strength of the contribute to scientific breakthroughs resolving the big sectors of water agriculture and food horticulture social issues and increasing our economic success and source materials high tech life sciences chemistry energy logistics and the creative industry we need such higher education system because our the approach makes it possible to implement ambitions are high the netherlands wants to rank among an integrated government policy for each sector the top knowledge economies this requires broad base this provides optimum guarantee that the choices of high quality higher education and research and strong with regard to education and research for example research focus areas the government wants to bring about together serve the interests of the sector companies strong connection between economic policy for the top knowledge institutions and the government will sectors and policy for higher education and research jointly identify bottlenecks and opportunities for making choices and focusing on one own strengths are each top sector because these three parties together the key words the netherlands will advance if we opt for pre eminently possess the necessary knowledge focused effort aimed at limited number of economic on june the top teams comprising top sectors and big social challenges for dutch higher figurehead from the sector representative from education and research focusing is equally important science senior civil servant and an innovative top it increases quality and ensures that higher education entrepreneur from the sme sector presented their and research can play their crucial roles in the further agendas the top teams advocated more cohesion development of the dutch economy and society and the development of research focus areas in education improving the alignment of education and in its trade and industry memorandum the government the labour market with particular attention paid to outlined its approach to making the netherlands more technology and setting up research and innovation innovative more entrepreneurial and more competitive for each top sector before the day of the the approach to nine top sectors is pivotal in this in the queen speech the government will respond to the golden triangle of the business community knowledge agendas presented by the top teams institutions and the government agendas are being drawn up with actions that are necessary to keep the sectors on the map also in an international perspective according to the recommendations of the top sectors public private collaboration among the education and research sectors the government and the business community is crucial in this the report of the committee on the future sustainability of the dutch higher education system committee has persuaded the government and the entire field of higher education that quality boost is needed in higher education and that comprehensive changes are therefore urgently required dutch higher education is generally of good quality but the ambitions of the netherlands require an increase in quality furthermore the quality of the bachelor degree in professional higher education is no longer undisputed doubt has arisen regarding the quality of the diploma the government has already presented its proposals on this point in this strategic agenda further propose number of changes of direction to make the higher education system future proof house of representatives no house of representatives no house of representatives no see the policy response to the final report of the education alternatieve alternative graduation tracks house of representatives no experience abroad either studying or working students are better prepared for labour market in which international experience is increasingly essential all this is not new in higher education but by it will become common practice the study completion delay measures the introduction the higher education system in of social lending system in the master phase and the introduction of tuition fee differentiation means that students will pay more for higher education however they will receive better education and an inspiring climate for study in return as departure point will outline the perspectives for professional higher education higher education and science in in this strategic the strength of the universities of applied sciences lies in agenda the government has purposely opted for their professional orientation this professional orientation perspective that is farther away than the end of the term is central to all the bachelor degree programmes master of office of this government in this way it becomes more degree programmes and practice oriented research obvious what changes in policy are needed and to what professional higher education graduates contribute to the policy choices this will lead in this government term innovative capacity of the professional practice for example of office they can analyse and optimise labour or production processes in order to do this they need research and entrepreneurial study climate skills education at university of applied sciences is in the study culture at universities of applied sciences therefore inter related with the practice oriented research and research universities will be characterised by challenge conducted by that university and there is intensive performance and getting the most out of your studies and co operation with the regional business community your own capabilities the bar has been raised and students and research universities this is what makes education who cannot jump over it will have to adjust their ambitions at universities of applied sciences into higher education this also requires primary and secondary education to raise professional higher education has different orientation the bar not every child is cut out for higher general but is perceived as equivalent to academic higher education secondary education havo or pre university education vwo neither can everyone be top researcher in much more differentiated range of programmes will be available to achieve this high quality level of we will have been able to raise the bar because the quality education some students will follow two year associate of the education provided by universities of applied sciences degree programme as step towards better position in the and research universities will have improved in the labour market or towards professional higher education teachers will also be better both and in terms hbo bachelor degree other students opt directly for of didactic skills moreover education will be much more professional bachelor degree programme enrolling in intensive more face to face hours and better student an excellence programme if this is within their capabilities teacher ratio furthermore the students will receive much furthermore there is larger group of students with better counselling with regard to their study options and pre university education qualifications who opt for study progress graduation within the standard timeframe professional orientation and are more at home in will be normal professional higher education than in academically oriented higher education this group of students with in such culture it is also normal that institutions can the pre university education qualification can attain select students for study programmes in this way groups professional bachelor level in an intensive three year of students can be created who stimulate one another due programme an interesting option for this group is that to their interests and efforts ambitious and excellent they can subsequently follow professionally oriented students are more challenged by broader range of honours master study programme and so obtain master title programmes the number of resits is also reduced to in four years just as in academic higher education wo combat delaying behaviour students are inspired because graduates with this professional master title are the for example they are involved in practice oriented or potential innovators in professional practice they have fundamental research at their institution or they can take state of the art knowledge and skills in their professional peek behind the scenes of professional practice during their area and are well grounded in terms of entrepreneurial and studies other students find it appealing that they can gain analytical skills this differentiation in the range of programmes available and master degree programmes will be characterised by requires from the universities of applied strong component of academic moulding and the sciences the uas have therefore made some sharp choices inter relation of research and education will be reinforced some institutions consciously focus on range of associate degree programmes and bachelor programmes because the inter relation of research and education is important their professional field needs graduates with these in master degree programmes but must also be reinforced qualifications other uas have chosen to develop in bachelor degree programmes especially with large challenging programmes for students entering with scale programmes to achieve this each institution needs pre university education qualifications and good to focus on its main strengths all the research universities performers with senior general secondary education and research institutes will develop much more stringent qualification their teachers and associate professors can own profile although the institutions have already taken handle this and they have an environment that supports the road of more profiling an intensive process of focus this choice for example through intensive collaboration on research and education will have truly changed the with research universities and on campus companies and landscape by due to the disciplinary through the development of public private collaborative of research universities not only are research and master ventures such as centres of expertise educational degree programmes reinforced but the quality of the goes hand in hand with profiling on content bachelor degree programme is also enhanced moreover the same education will no longer be offered in the same in academic higher education the connection between region by different universities of applied sciences the uas master degree programmes and the labour market will have made agreements about substantive division of tasks be improved because of increased collaboration with the and of the range of education programmes professional field every university will have more teachers and researchers per student resulting in strong this process of profiling between universities of applied community of students teachers and researchers within sciences and substantive has taken place in each discipline consultation with the professional field this is an absolute pre condition for the quality of professional higher where possible the university will engage in substantive education the needs of the labour market in the medium collaboration in this also with the most term and collaboration with employers public and private prominent national research institutes and the organised are leading for the range of study programmes and business community there is still difference in breadth practice oriented research the universities of applied among the research universities in the netherlands but sciences focus specifically on the needs of the economic process of focusing on research areas has also taken place top sectors and the important social sectors such as health in the general research universities every university is of care and education world class in its field collectively all the disciplines are sufficiently covered is primarily expressed in finally the culture at the universities of applied sciences the research and the subsequent research master degree in will be one of quality quality is central in all levels programme the research universities have ensured full of management and determines the policy options of the range of the larger degree programmes for the bachelor institution the teachers associate professors and phase but the choices they have made in the bachelor examiners are the people who monitor the quality of degree programmes chime in with the research focus areas education all teachers have at least master title or of the institution phd furthermore the quality of education has been considerably increased and the knowledge base reinforced this process of profiling will ensure reinforcement of by the range of study programmes the bar will the image and reputation of the dutch knowledge system be raised for students through national exams for core at home and abroad every prospective student or researcher subjects at home and abroad knows which dutch university to attend for which disciplines if he wants to follow the academic higher education best education or do world class research national and education at research university is oriented towards international companies and certainly those in the top academic forming it challenges students to approach sectors know the reputations of institutions collaborate complex issues from different perspectives students intensively with them and can therefore find the graduates learn to fathom theories and search for verification or that best match their company needs and innovative falsification some students will be seized by the science companies and investors know where the best research in and want to develop into researchers other students will their fields is being conducted take their academic approach to problems along with them into professional practice in all academic bachelor science the research landscape in will have number of distinct internationally recognised and competing research focus areas which are eminently able to acquire european funding because they are well embedded in strong european alliances these research focus areas will attract foreign students and research talent the development of research focus areas is rooted in the scientific challenges for future knowledge development in the social challenges of the society of tomorrow and in their contribution to current and future economic top sectors fundamental and open research the basis for future knowledge development and for innovation and renewal will be given sufficient room scientific quality and impact are the most important criteria for forming these research focus areas within the research focus areas there is close collaboration with companies from the dutch top sectors and with social organisations for the answers to the big challenges of this century the research focus areas lead to new innovative activity publicly and privately funded research is in good agreement such knowledge clusters have arisen around in areas such as food and flowers water energy and healthy aging the region is therefore an important anchor point collaboration is after all easier in one another physical proximity this type of regional collaboration already exists in various places in the netherlands such as the high tech campus in eindhoven the wageningen research centre or the bio science park in leiden collaboration is not limited to the regions however national and international collaboration also contributes greatly to research focus areas the connections between fundamental research practice oriented research applied research innovations in companies and social renewal will be much stronger and more firmly embedded in alongside scientific quality and the criterion of excellence economic and social impact are central values in the science system as is the room for inter and multi disciplinary collaboration and developing new fields researchers will be more esteemed for their entrepreneurship results from scientific research will therefore find their way more easily and quickly into innovative products processes and services scientific research also makes huge contribution to the resolution of social issues we resolve them in the netherlands but also of course in other countries where people have the same problems european and international collaboration will be more intensive in the range of programmes will benefit the quality effectiveness and transparency of education the committee therefore advocates more profiling by institutions the prevention of fragmentation and more attention for profiling are two sides of the same coin the system benefits as whole if institutions specialise more focus on their strengths and phase out weak programmes the state of the current higher and disciplines current fragmentation means that it is more difficult for students to make choice one third of education system students stops with the programme after year or switches to different programme this is partly because students do not sufficiently look around before they make their choice in addition both universities of applied sciences and research universities provide insufficient differentiation to work towards this long term perspective number of in their range of programmes weak spots in the current higher education system will need to be tackled the quality of higher education is generally second weakness in the system is that it is good but must be improved the committee gives equipped to deal with the diversity of the student cutting analysis of the shortcomings in the dutch higher population consequently on the one hand students are education system in its report the netherlands goal is to be challenged and on the other dropout rates among the top most competitive economies in the world we will are high although at the netherlands takes middle not achieve this if we continue in the same way dutch higher education position internationally with regard to success rates it has to improve lot and improve quickly the drop out rate is too high is undesirable that only just under two thirds of higher talent is not challenged enough and there is too little flexibility in the education students has diploma after six to seven years system to properly serve the varied needs of students and the labour and only after four years more differentiation in market yet research universities and universities of applied form and level is needed there are too few programmes for sciences must fight for their position in an increasingly excellent students currently of students in academic international context that is highly competitive in nature higher education are enrolled in an excellence programme the committee therefore believes that the current system is not versus only in professional higher education future proof the recommendation is add powerful impetus to it is also illustrative that the proportion of students with improving the quality and diversity of dutch higher education pre university education qualification among those entering professional higher education has declined the committee established that higher education drastically from in to in moreover is under pressure due to the growth in student numbers in comparison with other countries the netherlands has the expectation is that in the total enrolment rates will few students in short higher education programmes in rise by in full time professional higher education hbo partly in this light start was made with associate and in academic higher education wo compared to degree programmes at this time over students are in the number of students enrolled will total following such programme in international terms the more than this increase is necessary on the one proportion of master students in the netherlands hand all talent counts in view of the needs of the labour is also limited the latter is related to the relatively large market shortages can be expected especially in the fields size of dutch professional higher education in which of health care education and science technology at the bachelor degree is the final qualification same time the growth cannot be properly accommodated without fundamentally adjusting the system greater diversity in the programmes available is not only important to better serve the student population but also the most important issue in higher education is that quality to meet the demands of the labour market the demand for must be raised across the board the system has number more highly educated personnel is increasing furthermore of weak spots moreover first of all the range of education the work is becoming more complex and more functional programmes is too fragmented more stringent choices in differentiation is arising in various sectors good case in committee education source reference estimate his eurostat ser in their analyses the so called top teams also figure he data refer to shortages of science technicians in the top sectors ocw monitor education council point is the position of nurse practitioner in health care the public and private sectors the development of such restructuring of tasks and the necessary educational strategic partnerships in the whole knowledge chain is level is also taking place in legal circles the demand from crucially important between knowledge institutions the labour market is therefore also subject to change the business community governments and social furthermore the labour market is becoming more organisations collaboration within the european union international in character especially for higher education likewise gives strong boost to national research and graduates this requires proper between innovation potential firm steps will have to be taken educational institutions and the professional field here too to achieve focus combine strengths discourage currently this differs from sector to sector fragmentation and reduce duplication of effort this is good thing because the sectors are different in nature must however become more furthermore the application and impact of research lags structural and sustainable in nature behind its excellent quality many results of research still fail to find their way or do not find their way quickly the committee further highlights two structural enough to application in the business community or defects that pose threat to quality in the higher education health care security or education the results of research system the first is insufficient inter relation of education must lead to innovative products processes services and and research academic higher education is under pressure new industry more quickly this is important to strengthen from the large influx of students this applies especially to our competitive position with knowledge along the the arts and social science sectors in professional higher knowledge education profit line in the pipeline which education practice oriented research is as yet insufficient runs from fundamental research via applied research to to adequately enrich the programmes and innovation in the innovation the netherlands is doing well on the face business community in the coming years practice oriented of it but less well behind the scenes investments from research must therefore be expanded the second defect companies in particularly small and medium sized concerns the level of the teachers in professional higher enterprises are lacking as is the use of risk capital there education the educational level of these teachers is too is insufficient cohesion between private and public low in the international perspective as well in academic efforts the top sectors approach of this government is higher education the problem is the attention given to primarily focused on improving this situation but this teaching in comparison with research rather than the problem is also given attention in this strategic agenda educational level of the teachers this is why investment in the didactic qualifications of the staff is also needed in finally the netherlands has relatively few researchers academic higher education doctoral candidates and doctors the nowt report established that the netherlands has the lowest proportion state of science of researchers and other staff in the labour force in with citation score of and fourth place globally comparison with the reference countries except for china the quality of dutch research is first class and china is engaged in tremendous catching up process there are around doctoral candidates in the moreover dutch publicly financed researchers are also very netherlands in over phds were awarded productive with of global knowledge production this means the number of doctors has increased by the netherlands is relatively sizeable player nevertheless since nevertheless the netherlands rank th the country is too small to shine at everything and choices in europe when it comes to the relative number of doctors will constantly have to be made the knowledge landscape eu as result intensive companies have must develop more distinct profile to remain difficulty finding people and that there are very few teachers internationally visible the institutions have already gone with doctor degree in professional higher education or through considerable process of making choices and secondary education for example however in contrast profiling nonetheless there are signals that they have the proportion of support staff in the netherlands is succeeded in achieving focus and mass significantly higher than in other countries therefore want the institutions to better co their profiling choices with one another they will also have to expand their mutual collaboration because the netherlands can still gain great many benefits of scale by improved collaboration both within the public sector and between institute nowt source outlined changes of direction are only possible if all the partners in higher education research universities universities of applied sciences teachers students and researchers are involved and commit themselves to the collective future prospect employers in the public and private sectors must also play an important role strong and autonomous institutions are needed to achieve these changes of direction are needed ambitions the great autonomy of our higher education institutions is the strength of our system however such autonomy calls for accountability and taking responsibility that is why want to make agreements with the institutions collectively and individually about the performances they will have to deliver in the areas of quality and profiling number of radical changes of direction are needed to the government realises that much is being asked of the make the dutch higher education system future proof institutions given their budgetary considerations higher these apply to the policy of the government as well as that education is taking on its tasks expeditiously however of the institutions the changes are stricter study climate raise the bar for students more with this strategic agenda am indicating what course intensive education more selection and larger financial higher education research and science will take in the contribution from students quality of education above coming years am also doing this on behalf of the quantity of students chapter minister of economic affairs agriculture and innovation restructuring the range of programmes more profiling the agenda contains concrete elaboration of the and more differentiation in education gearing education recommendations of the committee this agenda to the differences in the talent and abilities of students therefore continues to build on the previously issued and the needs of the labour market reduction of the government response to these recommendations fragmented range of programmes when composing the agenda made use of two advisory collaboration in the knowledge chain of fundamental reports first of all the report that prof dr research practice oriented research applied research and prof dr van hereafter and innovation network organisations with collective the working group on profiling and funding drafted at my public private knowledge accumulation instead of each request this report entitled towards increased profiling with their own expertise thus improving the utilisation in higher education and research process approach to of research chapter profiling and profile based funding has provided me profiling and of institutions strengthening with important building blocks for the realisation of the the focus of research rewarding quality and profiling in recommendations of the committee the funding of research universities and universities of furthermore the social and economic council of the applied sciences chapter netherlands has recently published report on this strategic agenda the education council will advise on the strategic will develop these topics in the following chapters in agenda this summer the advice of the education council each chapter will indicate what the policy objectives are will be submitted to the house of representatives before for and what concrete steps will be taken during parliament deals with the strategic agenda this government term of office will pay special attention to the contribution of higher education to the top sectors in chapter will give summary of the main points of the strategic agenda chapter is the financial section house of representatives

called solar cooker an oven powered by solar energy are often hidden in subtle distinctions and that neither the which is suitable for the african market internet nor politics are above criticism and who can not only practice profession but also innovate within that last year students enrolled in the automotive course at the profession to that end it is necessary that our students han university

inter ev completely electrically powered sports car related with research this is not vision far away in the future randomly selected practical cases below from the trade management student focused on asia at the bachelor degree programme illustrate this point they are rotterdam university of applied sciences has concluded examples that make it clear that talent and passion are given business deals in china with his own import company significance in different places and that our students will involving the export of bicycle components manufactured in produce magnificent performances if the bar is raised china to the dutch market so it is there already challenging education that gets two years ago students at van hall uas the best out of students but it is not enough the problem demonstrated that it is feasible to combine biogas and analysis in the previous chapter speaks for itself an ethanol plant on farm in recent years many institutions have taken some steps towards an ambitious study culture and more study success but the present quality debate concerning professional higher education the high dropout rates and the degree of dissatisfaction among graduates with their programmes shows that true quality culture is still lacking in many places and therefore great deal of potential is lost that is why the bar must be raised across the board both in the programmes themselves and for the students high examination requirements in general secondary education and secondary vocational education intake and selection at the gates of higher education more face to face hours and smaller teaching groups especially in the first years of the bachelor phase excellently qualified teachers excellence in education strict requirements regarding study progress fewer resits and rock solid assurance of the generic quality these are bird eye view of the measures that must bring this about cf onderwijs investigative education annual speech of the president of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences core subjects increasing the performances of the best achieving students in pre university education and an increase in the percentage of students taking exams in more subjects than the statutory minimum raising the bar in higher education will have reinforcing effect admission requirements improving currently educational entry requirements apply for students with senior general secondary or pre university within education education diploma no such requirements are in place for students with secondary vocational education level qualifications as result these students have access to the whole of professional higher education even to sectors that do not inter relate whatsoever with their prior education quality of the incoming students thus students that have completed an assistant teacher the quality of higher education is largely determined by training programme at secondary vocational education the quality of the incoming students in recent years lot institution have the right to admission to professional of attention has been paid to the quality of the exams in higher education engineering technology programme general secondary education and secondary vocational research shows that dropout rates are highest among education this will also remain priority during this students that opt for non related graduate study government term of office as shown in the action plan programme conversely success rates can be regarded for secondary vocational education focus op vakmanschap as good for related transfers for example from secondary focus on craftsmanship the policy for vocational education engineering technology to the language and mathematics learning continuity professional higher education engineering technology pathways will be continued in secondary vocational will make it possible by law that universities of applied education english will become mandatory subject for sciences can set further educational entry requirements secondary vocational education level examination for students with secondary vocational education of language and mathematics will take place via central background self evidently these requirements for examinations implemented by the examinations board entrant students must be made known in time will administrative sanctions will be imposed on programmes further develop this in the legislation in support of the with inadequate examination quality the sector in implementation of this strategic agenda with input from collaboration with the business community is working the secondary vocational education field hard on examination standards so called examination profiles to improve the exams for another group of students with high dropout rate is that oriented subjects another goal outlined in of students who embark on academic higher education the said action plan is that in future secondary vocational following the part of professional higher education institutions may only use exams that comply education they drop out at much greater rate than with national seal of approval for the examination of students with pre university education qualifications oriented subjects the minister of education the current further educational entry requirements in culture and science has asked the examinations board to academic higher education are linked to pre university work out proposal for this and will decide on that basis education and are inadequate for students who have when this obligation will come into force completed the part of professional higher education without pre university education diploma reference levels for language and mathematics have also research universities may henceforth set admission been introduced in secondary education in addition the requirements for this category of students these students examination requirements have been tightened up the therefore no longer have right to admission scores for the central exam must average satisfactory level and no more than one is allowed for the core subjects the policy for the coming period described in the action plan for secondary education beter presteren improved performance primarily focuses on making dutch students perform better in reading proficiency maths and science by and on the realisation of an ambitious learning culture this is mainly manifested in increasing the percentage of students that achieve top performances in education council study options achieve this goal the government will continue to support wrong choice of study is one of the most important this development in the coming years resources have been reasons why so many students drop out in the first year reserved for general secondary education as well as study career guidance and information are often secondary vocational education inadequate many incoming students stop in the first year of their studies in professional higher education an in this respect set great store by bringing about average of drops out in academic higher education collaboration between the education sectors between about of the students who transfer from secondary general secondary education and higher education and education and prematurely break off their studies are between secondary vocational education and professional of the opinion that the wrong choice of study was one of higher education the co ordination of the different the reasons for their dropping out information and study options must be improved also to reinforce each other this must happen in the regions propose the following measures to improve the quality between educational institutions mutually and on of choice of study national level moreover good example of national good extension services based on reliable information collaboration is the informatie onderwijs and proper career orientation and study options collaboration platform for information on education guidance established at the end of last year in which the sector advancing the registration date and the wide organisations of primary education general secondary implementation of study options interviews education secondary vocational education and agricultural the promotion of broadly based bachelor programmes training the netherlands association of universities of see applied sciences and the association of universities in the netherlands make agreements about unambiguous transfer information career orientation and study data among other things interesting examples at the options guidance regional level are the pre university colleges in leiden prospective students must be better prepared for their eindhoven and the north of the country these offer choice of study research by the education council among extremely motivated students from the upper years of others shows that young people could make much more pre university education the opportunity to follow use of independent study options information such as the curriculum at the university completion of the curriculum web site funded by the ministry of education culture and leads to diploma or certificate this diploma may entitle science nl study options this web site the student to exemptions depending on the judgement of can be improved with respect to information about the the examining board of the university at which the student quality of the programme such as the number of face to will ultimately study such initiatives will also have to be face hours size of the group and relevant quality created between senior general secondary education and assessments the professional profile and labour market professional higher education pilot projects have been prospects of programmes such as chances of job at the launched to this end they will primarily focus on level of the programme job search duration and average reinforcing the vocational orientation of senior general starting salary agreements will be made with the board of secondary education the pilot studies will also investigate the foundation in which both the students how collaboration between senior general secondary and the institutions are represented education and professional higher education can be applied on wider scale research has also shown that providing more insight into what students can expect later in professional practice and in their career prospects can considerably improve the choice process here career orientation and study options guidance in general secondary education and secondary vocational education will play key role in both sectors of education there is great awareness that the quality of the career orientation and study options guidance lob can and must be increased secondary schools and secondary vocational education institutions are working hard to figure he data roa education council completion of the programme in which they wish to enrol another good example of collaboration these interviews have been tried in recent years in eleven is the algemene pilot studies at research universities and universities of general study skills alignment module the module applied sciences in over study options helps students to assess whether academic higher interviews were held with candidate students in these education is the correct choice for them if it fits in projects students and teachers are highly enthusiastic in with their interests and competences in the the meantime the rotterdam university of applied sciences meantime the technical university of delft and the has decided to hold an intake interview with all incoming university of leiden have developed four modules in students prospective students who have had study collaboration with the secondary education sector in options interview consider themselves better informed and their own region one for each secondary school more aware of their aptitude for the programme and of subject cluster possible points for improvement in their study behaviour or approach yet the interviews also have other effects it turns various universities of applied sciences han fontys out that they promote the feeling of bonding with the avans university of applied sciences utrecht programme according to the evaluation study of the university of applied sciences and rotterdam pilots another advantage of the interviews is that they university of applied sciences have combined their enable the programmes to gain better knowledge of the strengths in the framework of the national action incoming students plan for learning to develop generic competence index for professional higher education in the meantime this has resulted in the creation of the kies the university of utrecht and the utrecht university actief choose actively module that prospective of applied sciences have jointly set up the centrum students can use to establish whether studying at study options centre this office professional higher education level is right for them targets students in pre university education years and and secondary vocational education it gives customised personal advice on their subsequent the university students criticise the quality of the study education based on interests motivation and abilities information offered via the brochures of the institutions tests the office also brings prospective students into in so far as this criticism is justified the institutions will be contact with teacher and student from the held to account after all under the higher education and programme they are interested in if the student does research act whw they are obliged to provide not find suitable programme in either institution information to students that give them good picture of the office makes sure that the student receives an the content and organisation of the education programme appointment with contact person of another in its education and examination regulations the institution institution must make clear what the student may expect if the institution does not provide what the student could reasonably have expected it could be accused of institutions need time to plan and execute study options attributable non performance or an unlawful act which interviews this is why it is necessary to advance the would entitle the student to compensation under common registration date students often register late because law dutch civil code general administrative law act of the summer holidays there is no time to conduct study options interviews before the start of the college year study options interviews and advancing the students who opt for the wrong programme can thus no registration date longer be advised to take different one specific agreement will be made with the universities of applied sciences and research universities in the framework the law will have to be amended in order to advance the of the performance agreements regarding quality and study registration date for higher education programmes the success about bringing down dropout rates in the first year period after registration is intended for choosing final to this end research universities and universities of applied study option will take may as the latest registration date sciences have been given the opportunity to widely this is several weeks before the secondary school exams implement study options interviews study options this date will be the same for all first year bachelor students interview is designed to give students more self in all government funded higher education institutions understanding in addition it provides them with better students who register too late via after may information about factors that determine the successful become admissible that is to say the institution can institute determine under what conditions the student will as yet be admitted these conditions must be clearly established in the teaching and examination regulations of the programme this will entail submitting motivation letter holding study options interview or comparable conditions directed at advancing the study options process for programmes with selection different rules apply to registration for programmes with limited capacity students must in principle register before january institutions and students will receive the legal right to request study options interview students are obliged to attend study options interview if the institution invites them to and conversely institutions are obliged to conduct study options interviews if students request one the interview as is now the case in the pilots is advisory in nature naturally the development of this measure will be properly with the graduate programme and senior secondary vocational education and its effects will be monitored the institutions will be paid on bonus malus basis will monitor the results based on indicators that provide picture of the determinative factors concerning quality and study success in context these agreements will be explained in chapter as announced in the coalition agreement these resources raising the bar will be primarily used to increase educational intensity this should ensure sufficient interactive time between students and teachers and more small group teaching research has shown that the study success of student increases if he is part of small group the student is then socially and academically embedded this feeling of being policy is directed towards giving firm boost to the quality at home in faculty for which contacts with fellow students culture in higher education the measures in this section and staff are essential is seen as good protection against focus on premature dropout and study completion delay furthermore small scale teaching ensures that students intensive and pro active education are assisted to study regularly as they are required to engage an ambitious study culture in critical discussions of what they have acquired via self selection on admission instruction students in small scale education also appear excellent programmes to learn more curricula that have relatively few dropouts and little study completion delay are usually small scale intensive and pro active education in design and employ pro active forms of education as raising the bar first of all means that students may require departure point for example problem driven education more from the programme than is now on offer students at the university of maastricht think things could be better as satisfaction survey among graduates shows around quarter of professional higher indicators for pro active curriculum and small scale education graduates was dissatisfied with the scope depth approach are the number of face to face hours and the and degree of difficulty of the programme third thinks staff student ratio for some time the number of face to that the level of the programme was face hours has been concern in higher education policy challenging moreover thought that teachers were according to an education report published not strict enough in their assessments and devoted little in approx of all programmes offered an average attention to study progress in academic higher education of fewer than ten face to face hours per week in the first of graduates was not satisfied with the scope or year of study an update will follow this autumn this is depth of the programme not acceptable for full time programmes certainly not in the first year after all in this way the students are not now that the basic student grant in the master phase has activated to learn the material and connect with the been converted into loan and students will actually pay programme therefore intend to see to it that all more for higher education they should be able to expect programmes are required to provide more than ten better education the quality boost in this agenda which face to face hours and will make agreements about this will be funded partly from the revenues of the student with the research universities and universities of applied grants and loans measure and the study completion delay sciences also want to make agreements with individual measure is directed at achieving this in the coalition institutions about increasing the number of face to face agreement an amount was reserved increasing from hours here will take into account the insights provided million in to million in and million by research into the relationship between face to face hours structurally in this government term of office and self instruction and their effects on success rates will make performance agreements with the institutions about spending these resources these agreements will include ambitious but achievable goals and objectives see van der drift and vos and rug in these studies face to face hours were positioned as precondition for self instruction face to face hours should be directed towards significant self instruction the higher the number of hours roa of self instruction in programme per instruction hour the better www nl the learning achievements in these agreements will also involve the staff student ratio with measures like more focused matching between because this is an indicator of group size as have already student and study small scale intensive education and remarked being part of small group is important to the the modernisation of examination arrangements the latter study success of students most groups in higher education in the form of pilots eur wants to substantially improve cannot be called small the current ratio between staff and the study progress of students enrolled in its programmes students averages in research universities and updating the examination arrangements comes down to universities of applied sciences for comparison in university restriction of the number of resits for interim colleges this is their success rate after four years examinations averages the average success rate of academic the implementation of compensatory examination bachelor programmes is after four years arrangements compensation between or within subjects the three technical research universities require special the requirement to complete the first year of bachelor attention although these institutions enjoy high quality programme before embarking on the second year and reputation they have for some time scored low for dropout to complete the second year before embarking on the rates and success rates also in comparison with the other third this also requires issuing negative binding research universities this can be explained in view of the recommendations regarding the continuation of studies weight and degree of difficulty of technical programmes after the first year in case of insufficient progress but from the viewpoint of the need of the labour market for technically trained people and the appropriateness of in the law programme provided by the eur in these government resources it is highly undesirable measures will be accompanied by complete review of the curriculum where the students receive small scale from the block grant resources of the previous government education in different block groups law firms or law structural million extra is available for the three colleges according to the tutorial model in this way technical research universities with effect from this year the student is immediately involved in an ambitious study want these research universities to use this budget for environment students proceed from year to year as group teaching in the coming years with the three technical without workload and wherever possible they graduate research universities will make separate performance collectively within the standard timeframe or with one agreements about using this budget to increase the influx year study completion delay class of of students and the success rates of the programmes embrace this pilot and will facilitate the eur and other the primary education process must be central for me this institutions that want to start work on this with legislation is the point of departure for the performance agreements and regulations where we are initially particularly thinking with the research universities and universities of applied of using the experimentation proviso in the higher sciences will consider where overheads can be reduced education and research act this concerns experiments without the primary process will also make whose effects on quality and the counselling of students agreements about reducing the administrative burden for must be carefully monitored the institutions here am thinking mainly of regulations that have no relationship with the quality of education the above measures can result in students who do not comply with the increased requirements and therefore ambitious study culture drop out of higher education this is despite the fact that students may ask more of their education yet education ambitious quality agendas are being implemented in may also ask more of the students an ambitious study secondary vocational education and general secondary culture exists after all by the grace of mutual obligations education as result of which students are better prepared an interaction between the efforts of the student and for higher education the increased possibilities for the good teaching by the programme partly due to the study intake and selection of students see also the following completion delay measures and the social lending system section could partly discourage this because any for the master phase expect that students will pay more deficiencies can be detected in time furthermore more attention to their study progress and put more time into differentiation in education is necessary to ensure that their studies studying will again receive the highest programmes can be geared to the different backgrounds priority this is what we aspire to and qualities of the students we are also working on this see chapter nonetheless will take account of the risk in an ambitious study culture studying within the standard of extra dropouts due to raising the bar in the performance or nominal timeframe must be the rule and not the agreements with the institutions exception an interesting initiative was taken by erasmus university rotterdam eur nominal normal eur selection on admission the educational profile on the basis of which selection the growing influx of students into higher education provides would be allowed can be related to the education concept an opportunity for institutions to frame differentiation and the entry or final level of the programme or its content quality under pressure this calls for instruments with which the profile need not be unique but should be distinctive institutions can quickly put the right student in the right and clear selection criteria must result place in that context selection on admission is relevant selection on admission furthermore enhances the motivation selection criteria can relate to previous educational and efforts of students conscious selection and self selection achievements such as the minimum score required for are thereby encouraged selection on admission also has an relevant subjects or subjects in which general secondary effect on how prospective students perform in preparatory education or secondary vocational education exams must programmes they usually achieve higher scores because their have been taken or for example abilities or motivation chances of admission increase selection fosters more the method of selection must involve combination of challenging study culture and high quality education criteria as research has shown that study success is through selection student groups often become more influenced by various factors it is therefore not intended homogeneous in composition or motivation which advances that selection will be exclusively related to for example the performance of all students finally as is also final exam results emphasised by the working group on profiling and funding allowing increased selection gives the institutions more room clear education and or professional profiles as outlined for profiling here are an exception in the current situation this will change after the perspective outlined in chapter comes because of the positive effects of selection the into view and the profiling of institutions and programmes committee advocates making selection on admission gains ground this will be gradual development will possible for all higher education institutions in this make agreements with the higher education institutions government term of office number of steps will be about the programmes to which selection may be applied taken in the light of that perspective this first of all involves because they already have clear educational or professional the room for talent bill which was adopted earlier this profiles these agreements are part of the performance year by the house of representatives this bill offers the agreements regarding quality and profiling further details following possibilities are provided in chapter the number of programmes to programmes where the quality of education is under which selection may be applied will be gradually expanded pressure because the groups of students are too large in this manner the advantage of this approach is also that can regulate their capacity on the basis of qualitative the effects of selection on quality study success and selection the institutions are given this possibility profiling remain suitably monitored to regulate capacity at the programme level programmes that can be as small scale admission via drawing lots does not tie in with system in residential education such as the university colleges which the between student and programme may select students on admission must be reinforced drawing lots will consequently be phased out furthermore in this strategic agenda propose to make selection on admission possible to an even greater extent excellent tracks my point of departure is that selection must always be various studies for example those conducted by the directed towards better between the level netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis cpb and the profile of the programme on the one hand and show that talented students are challenged the abilities and motivation of the students on the other in the netherlands it is exactly this top segment we need against this background propose that programmes with so desperately for scientific breakthroughs and innovative clear educational or professional profile receive the activity education programmes must offer an appropriate possibility to set selection requirements programmes and challenging scope for these top talents of course this with clear professional profile are for example the arts needs to start in primary and secondary education where programmes and the hotel schools for programmes with the policies of this government have contributed to clear educational profile am thinking of programmes powerful boost to excellence especially in pre university with high final level strong international orientation education or an intensive study climate committee cpb en house of representatives no however such boost is also called for in higher education considerable gains can be achieved here in the previous government term of office national proportion of was agreed with the institutions in regarding the percentage of students engaged in more than the regular bachelor programme resources were received from the sirius programme nevertheless current percentages are still very low especially in professional higher education approx versus in academic higher education recent research by has shown that excellence programmes in professional higher education increase the appeal of professional higher education for pre university students universities of applied sciences have been challenged to make an extra effort in this respect more collaboration between the different sectors of education to arrive at suitable supply of excellence will also have effect here to further promote excellence propose the following measures will make new performance agreements with the research universities and universities of applied sciences regarding the percentage of students participating in excellent education shall start from the current target figure of institutions may raise the tuition fees for more expensive excellent programmes they then have more opportunity to profile themselves on excellence extra resources can be tapped via tuition fee differentiation in addition to the government grant the extra income can be used for extra facilities to reach and maintain higher level such as more teachers guest lecturers or extra workload thus the costs of these facilities need not be paid from the budget for the regular programmes against this background tuition fee differentiation will be made possible via the ruim baan voor talent room for talent bill for programmes involving residential small scale and intensive education such as the university colleges furthermore propose to also make higher tuition fees possible for programmes focused on higher final level the higher fees would only apply to track within the programme the rest of the programme remains accessible for the statutory college fees for programmes with an excellent assessment from the accreditation organisation of the netherlands and flanders this by definition concerns programmes with great added value the link with the assessment makes it transparent that students are getting extra quality for the higher tuition fees international comparative research carried out in with ten other european countries however showed that not only is the percentage of teachers with phd in dutch professional higher education still relatively low but the percentage of master and phd together is also much higher in other countries averaging almost in view of the rising trend in the numbers of master and phds in better equipped teachers dutch professional higher education so far the current financial resources seem to make it possible for more details see the financial overview to raise the bar here higher than the current ambition my goal is that of professional higher education teachers will have master degree or phd by the first step on that road teachers are the bearers of educational quality we only is in we are also aiming to train teachers whose receive the education we need if we have good teachers practical knowledge can enrich education in order to who know their subjects and can inspire and bind nable them to earn master degree teacher quality will be one of the subjects in the performance professional higher education teachers must be better agreements will be making with the individual institutions trained with regard to subject content and in view of the the research universities have invested more in the teaching dissatisfaction of students on this point make stricter skills of their personnel in recent years to make career assessments to train professional higher education teaching skills and performances are increasingly decisive students to be the innovative professionals our knowledge alongside research achievements this is also necessary economy needs it is additionally necessary that the committee states expressly that research professional higher education is more strongly linked universities still tend to derive their prestige mainly from their research to practice oriented research results and that research universities must give more attention to teaching the adequate educational level of the teacher is the spearhead for the universities of applied sciences the research universities have for some time been working all teachers in professional higher education should with the so called basic and senior teaching qualification themselves hold master level degree to properly fulfil programmes bko sko for their teachers early the the role of subject teacher the goal set in the covenant bko covenant was implemented which applies to all leerkracht in the netherlands and the multi year agreement research universities this approach to raising the teaching with the netherlands association of universities of applied quality of new and sitting teachers has meanwhile gained sciences for the of het hoogste goed the wide support greatest good from was that of teachers would have master degree by and phd in another good development is the discipline networks for the current state of affairs is that of teachers in academic higher education teachers this is how the professional higher education has master degree research universities have interpreted the so called higher and has obtained phd it is gratifying to establish education academy outlined in the previous strategic that substantial growth can be seen compared to previous agenda these disciplinary innovation centres focus on years as shown in the table below improving the quality of bachelor degree programmes through the collaboration of teachers at different research universities these centres identify good examples and table educational level of teachers in professional higher conduct studies into teaching practice increasing efficiency education has special priority these innovation centres have recently been started in science and technology education with co funding from the ministry of ocw and will begin shortly bachelor for law studies there is also budget available for such master centres in professional higher education phd de weert soo source pomo staff and mobility study and committee ministry of the interior and kingdom relations bzk committee het hoogste goed the greatest good parliamentary paper no page the universities of applied sciences have already been invited to submit proposal in this regard will primarily assess whether the previously mentioned necessity for professional higher education teachers to make improvements in their subject matter knowledge has been adequately addressed also on the point of examinations consider the introduction of basic and senior teaching qualification programmes for teachers also useful in professional higher education as indicated in the action plan leraar een krachtig beroep teacher powerful profession intend to have the bko and sko approach also implemented in professional higher education by initiatives taken by the professional group of teacher trainers in academic higher education and professional higher education can serve as an example on this point am primarily concerned with in testing and examinations for more details see teachers in professional higher education must have sufficient professional capacity to fulfil examination tasks besides their teaching tasks and they must be sufficiently equipped in terms of knowledge level and skills table to better equip teachers the following resources are available quality of teachers job mix extra training resources training fund teacher scholarship drawing rights estimate national testing and source national budget education culture and science articles and institutions elsewhere in the world in many cases these relationships will demand international mobility from teachers good command of english is also very important in internationally oriented education and student surveys have shown that the english language international orientation skills of teachers in higher education are satisfactory most institutions have policy to improve teachers knowledge of english it remains no less important that students are internationally mobile during their education in this way can give significant boost to raising they learn to look across the borders and as graduates they the quality of higher education in the past decade the gain in appeal to an internationally oriented labour market collaboration among the european countries in the last year it was agreed in the framework of the bologna framework of the bologna process has been powerful process that of students in european higher education motor in this in education is expected in will follow part of their studies abroad for the to continue in the coming years institutions and students netherlands this percentage is currently approx the are increasingly less deterred by national borders this is goal for the netherlands is to increase this percentage to proven by the increasing significance of international by it was also agreed that opportunities for league tables and instruments for international student mobility would be created in the curricula this transparency and such as the qualifications will result in students not having to incur study completion framework for the european higher education area delays because they will follow part of their studies abroad qf the european qualifications framework for the possibility of offering joint degrees with institutions lifelong learning lll and map institutions abroad is very useful in this respect practise by offering international classrooms and joint degree programmes with foreign partners designing an international curriculum and benchmarking the quality of the programme with programmes from foreign institutions among other things the has developed distinctive quality feature for and in addition an certificate which will also be adopted by the european consortium for accreditation this has handed the institutions substantial tools for profiling themselves nationally and internationally on the issue of for internationally oriented students it is also important that we now have these tools teachers play leading part in designing internationally oriented education the international orientation of professional higher education teachers is however still limited the social and economic council of the netherlands ser and have both asked for attention to be paid to this the result could be that small and medium sized enterprises where the majority of professional higher education graduates end up are prepared for the global knowledge economy and miss out on opportunities of the international knowledge and experience of teachers see the report onderwijs in het ho english language benefits from relationships with colleagues companies and teaching in higher education parliamentary paper no see the agenda for higher education het transfer goed the boundless good parliamentary paper no reinforcing supervision the accreditation system will be adapted the universities of applied sciences must subject their programmes to comparative external review in national cluster research universities do this already external review panels will no longer be composed by the institutions but appointed by the quality assurance is central external review panels will henceforth have to attend lectures or other educational activities to obtain concrete picture of the didactic model of programme together the achieved final level and method of examination are currently one assessment criterion in view of the weighty importance of each of the topics the value of higher education diploma may absolutely will introduce clear distinction between these two not be open to question some doubts have unfortunately aspects this makes it clear that programme must be arisen in professional higher education the education satisfactory both in terms of examination methods and and the have conducted research achieved final level before it can be accredited herewith into signals about alternative graduation tracks and the am adopting the advice of the this will conclusions from these studies are frankly alarming for ensure that it can no longer be the case that any doubts number of programmes this concerns programmes that about the achieved final level in the assessment will have recently been accredited the findings of the remain without consequences to this end will amend and the also show that the existing the higher education and research act whw internal and external quality assurance mechanisms are with view to assessment of the quality of final projects not sufficient to detect and tackle problems in time quality it must be guaranteed that the assessment panel can problems are not brought to light quickly enough independently select the project to be assessed the assessment panel will make selection from full list the system has therefore not worked as it should if quality drawn up by the institution the accreditation framework problems are not promptly brought to light students could will be tightened up so that the random sample must wrongly receive certificate be representative of the whole programme and contain substantial number of sixes meaning just passed as indicated in the policy response to the final reports an initial accreditation is based on paper plans and on alternative graduation tracks my policy on this point is not on proven results uncertainty could arise about directed towards three goals the realisation of the plans the validity of an initial increasing the number of supervisory instruments accreditation is therefore limited the maximum term accreditation as well as supervision by the education of six years is only awarded if confidence has been earned so that quality problems can come to light in the quality assurance of the institution concerned promptly external validation of testing and examinations so there furthermore the role of the will be expanded is no reason to doubt the value of the diploma the new supervisory role of the will be good governance higher education institutions possess risk oriented and proportional based on factors that pose high degree of autonomy this is also the strength of risk to the quality of education and awarding degrees our system with the great autonomy offered by the law in the period between two if risks are to institutions however also come responsibility established further research at the institution will be accountability for quality and abiding by the regulations arranged this research is related to the legal assurances in the area of level monitoring the institutions must on the quality of the education and the diplomas such as live up to this the teaching and examination regulations the examining boards the internal quality assurance and the operation of participation in decision making signals from students can also be motivation for further research education the measures mentioned in this section apply to both universities of applied sciences and research universities unless otherwise stated consequences of the inspection visits the results of which shape will also agree on the steps to be taken in the will be made public could be coming years to accomplish application across the entire the visit produces questions for the next accreditation professional higher education sector and on the fields round of study that will be given priority the visit encourages the institution to make improvements if there are serious doubts the institution will make resources available to facilitate networks of must report its measures for improvement to the examiners who will act as external experts for other institutions at the same time wish to encourage if necessary the institution can be reported to the initiatives in the field of national testing will make total minister with view to starting the procedure for of million available for this in the period from withdrawing accreditation initial accreditation or the this step has already been taken for the teacher training institutional quality assurance test programmes failure to comply with legislation and regulations can result in funding cuts consider it important that academic higher education also make more use of national progress testing as it happens this new form of supervision is pro active risk oriented and the medical faculties have produced good examples of proportional in nature testing that reinforces the learning capacity of students as well as teachers while underlining the added value of the external validation programme other than in professional higher education in view of the education report on the however see no reason for its large scale roll out in assurance of diploma quality in professional higher principle inter relation with research and the educational education better guarantees must be provided regarding level of the teachers at research universities is sufficient the external of diplomas and testing practices guarantee of the level of academic higher education must be reinforced to that end professional higher diplomas education programmes need to reinforce their knowledge bases using approach it goes without saying that employers must be closely involved five medical faculties have collectively drawn up progress test which is administered four times year my point of departure is that at the end of this government the progress made by each student and institution term of office every professional higher education can be monitored and mutually compared this offers programme has made sure that their knowledge base has the institutions the opportunity to measure the added been reinforced and that testing and examinations are value of the education they provide during the externally validated to that end each programme will academic year thus they have an instrument with have to make use of national testing on one or more core which they can improve the quality of their own subjects or if national testing is not feasible deploy education external examiners am aware that the concrete interpretation of external validation cannot be the same for every programme it will not be possible to work with will arrange that every examining board has an external time and place independent testing for all programmes member managers with financial responsibility cannot as is now taking shape in teacher training programmes be included on an examining board the management this approach places very high demands on the testing enforcement legislative act indicates that this is the desired instruments such as national register of established test situation now wish to regulate this clearly the external items also want to provide room for other approaches member could bring in expertise on subject content or for to national and collective testing in the agreement on the example testing expertise it could be someone from the outlines of policy goals see chapter will agree with the professional field or colleague from another faculty or netherlands association of universities of applied sciences institution at home or abroad will consider how this can on the manner in which external validation and be achieved in actual practice during the elaboration of this reinforcement of the knowledge bases will take definitive legislative amendment will factor in the principle of cost effectiveness national testing distinguishes itself from central written exams for the time being shall assume that the external central examinations because the national testing only focuses on examiners and national testing of core subjects provide the core subjects there is no prescribed format the test can be taken sufficient guarantee for the external validation of diplomas at the end as well as during programme and the tests are jointly developed by the institutions reinforcing governance has been created with the management enforcement the final report by the education on the legislative act which came into force on september inholland university of applied sciences shows that internal the functioning of participation in decision making is supervision has been inadequate at various levels due to crucial in practice however institutions must invest in which the established shortcomings were not detected in improving their culture the formal position is in order time currently number of instruments is available since the institution of the management enforcement increasing in scope they range from discussion with the legislative act board via various steps including naming and shaming to legislation being enforced through funding sanctions the government lacks any means of focused intervention at the level of the board of an institution in my opinion the government should have such an ultimate authority if none of the interventions has worked the minister should have the authority to issue designation order as last resort the primary and secondary education sectors offer comparable possibility would like to incorporate the authority to issue designation order in the higher education and research act whw with the following core elements the authority to issue designation order is directed at the supervisory board the minister must be able to issue an order if he finds serious shortcomings in relation to the implementation of legal rules are considered serious if it is established that they have had negative consequences at the system level detrimental effects for negative impact on the system shortcomings involve including financial mismanagement unjustified enrichment wrongful acts proper participation in decision making is an important component of the checks and balances in the system expect the professional higher education institutions to enter into discussions with their present students about the quality of the programmes they are investigating because of the reports by the robust internal quality control is brought about by among other things critical participation in decision making students teachers and institutions must agree to make participation in decision making into tool for quality in the past year the functioning of participation in decision making at the system level has also been the subject of consultations with institutions and student organisations in those consultations impediments and solutions were the has also conducted research into the functioning of study programme committees on that basis want the study programme committees to put more emphasis on the task of advancing the quality of the programme in my opinion balanced structure for participation in decision making research universities and universities of applied sciences may select students on admission if selection is justified on the grounds of the profile of the programme or results from the professional requirements of the programme to promote the development of more excellent educational tracks the scope for tuition fee differentiation will be expanded what are we going to do better equipped teachers the educational level of professional higher education teachers is very low compared with other european countries by of teachers in professional higher education must have master or phd degree improvement of in average percentage in other countries is an education interim step is the percentage must then be the examination requirements in secondary vocational we will also strive to train to master level teachers who education and general secondary education are becoming can enrich education because of their practical stricter secondary education is aiming towards more knowledge ambitious learning culture by enhancing the the basic and senior teaching qualification programmes achievements of the top best performing pre for teachers which have already been implemented in university education students among other things academic higher education will also be introduced in the information given via nl will pay professional higher education explicit attention to the quality of the education provided and prospects on the labour market in order to allow quality assurance students to make more conscious study choice the will play greater role and will switch performance agreements are being made with the to new form of risk oriented supervision in the period universities of applied sciences and the research universities between two with regard to lowering dropout rates in the first year the accreditation system will be reinforced universities the government supports the development of better of applied sciences will have to allow their programmes career orientation and study options guidance lob in to be reviewed in national cluster and separate general secondary education and secondary vocational judgement of achieved exit qualifications will be leading education as to whether accreditation may be granted study options interviews will be widely implemented external experts must participate in every examining the registration date for students will be advanced to board managers with financial responsibilities may may to make this possible not be members of examining boards all professional higher education programmes reinforce raising the bar the knowledge base and ensure that testing and performance agreements will be made with the examination is externally validated this takes place institutions concerning the intensification of curricula by making use of national testing on one or more core education must have sufficient time for interactivity subjects for each programme or making use of external between students and teachers through more face to face examiners if national testing is not feasible hours or by working in small groups in the coalition the authority to issue designation order which is agreement sum of million in increasing directed at the board of supervision will be included to million in and ultimately million in the higher education and research act the minister structurally has been reserved in addition to the existing must be able to issue such an order if serious resources for study success approx million shortcomings are established in the implementation institutions are funded on bonus malus basis based on of legal rules indicators that provide view of quality and study success nominal study duration will become the rule instead of the exception pilots will start at higher education institutions to experiment with among other things year group system including compensation between subjects and binding recommendation regarding the next step in the person education after the second year more profiled and differentiated range of programmes the previous chapter makes it clear that the government wants to make significant headway with regard to improving development in new programmes the quality of higher education to that end the range of courses on offer must be adjusted it also calls for every year educational institutions submit requests for restructuring the range of programmes reduction in the new programmes before starting new programme number of programmes differentiation in the types of institutions must first go through macro efficiency programme and the introduction of more profile into the check followed by initial accreditation by the programmes the number of applications for new programmes reflects the growth of the programmes on offer one of the key messages from the committee was in the netherlands below is figure showing the that if we wish to develop the talents of dutch students to number of approved macro efficiency applications the maximum and we do we must differentiate the range for new programmes new locations or branches in of programmes on offer to far greater extent the student academic higher education and professional higher population is very diverse in terms of prior education interest education together in recent years in and level age etc to do justice to this diversity much more an experiment was carried out that involved leaving differentiated range of programmes must become available out the macro efficiency checking this explains the not every learning track suits every student with the policy sudden increase in the number of new programmes in choices in this chapter want to give institutions the those years opportunity to better serve their students institutions that want to profile themselves and specialise will definitely graphic nb figures from apply to professional receive the room to do so employers also attach value higher education only to more differentiation in the programmes in its recommendations for the strategic agenda the social and economic council of the netherlands ser has emphasised that more differentiation in terms of level is particularly important for the labour market this is why the ser for example advocates the associate degree and excellence programmes furthermore more flexibility is needed in education for those who are working to promote lifelong learning in order to achieve the quality improvement pursued by the government the range of programmes must also be compacted with more broad based bachelor programmes in professional as well as academic higher education professional higher education currently has over unique bachelor programmes academic higher education around for the master phase there are unique master degree programmes in professional higher education and in academic higher education most of the programmes are offered at several locations moreover the total range therefore includes around bachelor and master degree programmes in professional higher education and bachelor and master degree programmes in academic higher education restructuring of the programmes on offer could first of all increase their transparency employers indicate that with the current wide range of programmes on offer they find it difficult to determine the value of individual programmes more compact offer also enables employers to work on the quality of the programmes together with the institutions students also advocate bringing down the number of will elaborate the changes intended by the government programmes because the large quantity of courses makes in the programmes on offer for professional and academic their study choice unnecessarily difficult higher education separately in the sections hereafter will subsequently go into flexibility in higher education for with the proposals regarding profiling in this strategic those who are working agenda want to facilitate institutions in making conscious choices also for their programmes on offer this will therefore have to mean discontinuing programmes phasing out programmes or transferring programmes to other institutions it also means being restrained in starting new programmes the government will expedite the latter by only accepting applications for new programmes that match the profile of the institution in the strategic plan see chapter balanced proposal is made for the future range of programmes on offer in which new proposals go hand in hand with limitation of the existing range it also involves seeking collaboration organising joint national master degree programmes and periodically holding the national range of programmes on offer up to the light sector by sector in sectors of education where this is relevant for example because of functional differentiation on the labour market the programmes on offer in professional higher education and academic higher education will also be considered in their interconnection steps like this will increase the quality of the courses on offer the facilitation of more conscious choices by institutions also requires that the current legislation around new programme offers such as the macro efficiency policy should be reviewed amending this legislation is the necessary guarantee that new programmes will match the profile of the institutions the restructuring of the programmes offered and the priorities in this strategic agenda am thinking of periodic analyses of the existing programmes on offer for efficiency and answering the needs of students and the labour market more significant role for the needs of the labour market with new programmes especially the associate degree programmes and professional master see section room for broad based bachelor degrees see section room for part time higher education see section the proposed adjustments in the framework of the programmes on offer will be submitted to the house of representatives in the summer of at latest furthermore we will work on obtaining better labour market information to support the efficiency agenda and for the benefit of students study options feasibility study will be conducted into labour market indicators for the benefit of the new funding system iso reduction of the number of locations at which certain programme can be offered would contribute to the of the programmes on offer in professional higher education programmes are offered in many locations this is also more important in professional higher education than in academic higher education in view of the regional function of university of applied sciences nevertheless professional higher education more regional and co ordination is necessary and possible in professional higher education periodic reorganisation of the range of analyses of the programmes on offer by the programmes on offer and more committee for efficiency in higher education could differentiation be useful in this respect the institutions can include these analyses in the profiling of their programmes they would thereby contribute towards making appropriate agreements with the institutions about reduction of their range of programmes in terms of both labels and locations will in professional higher education restructuring of the challenge professional higher education to limit the number programmes on offer is important to strengthen the of programmes on offer via performance agreements this knowledge bases of the programmes this is easier if the will also be part of the outline agreement shall conclude range of programmes on offer is more compact as will with the universities of applied sciences explain in chapter want to conclude an outline agreement with the universities of applied sciences in which with the labour market when working on they collectively and individually commit to agreements on programme offer is naturally essential employers must the development of knowledge bases reduction of the be expressly involved in the restructuring of the range of programmes on offer and differentiation in professional courses the labour market relevance of higher education higher education must increase labour market demand will be leading in new offers of associate degree programmes and professional master see section the professional field will also be involved in the development of knowledge bases in professional higher education furthermore restructuring the programmes on offer in gearing to the professional field will be made condition professional higher education for acceptance of profiling proposals in professional higher education see chapter with respect to the top sectors restructuring the programmes on offer in professional and the proposals of the top teams demand will play part higher education must result in fewer programmes that in making education relate to professional practice these is to say fewer new programmes and of recommendations will be borne in mind with applications the existing ones in addition it is important to have more for new programmes the restructuring of the existing range broad based programmes in the context of professional of courses and in determining the necessity for sector plans higher education however broad based bachelor this requires action from higher education but also from degrees have different connotation than in academic the employers themselves it is up to sector organisations higher education see section in professional higher to clearly articulate their demand for higher education education it mainly involves not having too many sub graduates and their education needs to higher education variations of programmes the economy sector currently the business community could also indicate in which way has around different programmes and the technical they can contribute by offering internships scholarships sector has more than unique programme names for students and of subject teachers more many of them are more or less the same programmes but systematic collaboration in the regions or within the sectors registered under slightly different name in the central will benefit the quality of education register of higher education study programmes want the naming of programmes to be more unambiguous within the name of broad based programme the institution can of course include its own substantive profile the programmes on offer must match the profile and regional function of the university of applied sciences who are working the two year ad programme also seems good example of an initiative is the engineering to better relate to their interests and possibilities than technology sector plan for professional higher four year professional higher education bachelor education which is currently under development programme the government wants more associate degree this plan was initiated by the chemie programmes to be made available for this group of students steering group for the chemical sector in which the in its response to the committee report the universities of applied sciences and employers in the government indicated that the ad will definitely be chemical industry are represented its goal is to implemented to this end that is in line with what introduce more focus and mass into the programmes employers want on offer within the chemistry and life sciences sectors in professional higher education to this end the with the positioning of the ad the government has opted universities of applied sciences and employers are for the verification of the professional higher education jointly investigating the labour market needs for character of the ad as its point of departure proper higher education graduates in these disciplines how collaboration between secondary vocational education and the programme offer can tie in with these needs and professional higher education is essential but to guarantee how the intake of students for the programmes can the professional higher education level of the ad and offer be increased the engineering technology sector students professional higher education environment plan for professional higher education will be ready the ad remains part of the professional higher education in bachelor phase this furthermore guarantees the transfer possibility of the ad to bachelor exit level the consultations that held with the relevant parties based on the motion by de and van der ham support the government choice the netherlands association of vocational education colleges mbo raad differentiation in professional higher the confederation of netherlands industry and employers education vno ncw the entrepreneurs organisation mkb nederland and the netherlands association for training and the government will give professional higher education education all emphasise that the appeal of the the room it requires for far reaching differentiation of the ad largely lies in the fact that the ad is part of professional range of programmes the quality issues in professional higher education the further states that positioning higher education are partly connected with the fact that within secondary vocational education will have the professional higher education has particularly diverse effect of lowering the level and will make the step to the student population regard more streaming of students bachelor degree unnecessarily larger the mbo raad in professional higher education thus making more use also specifically sees the ad as higher education degree of different educational tracks for different groups as an therefore see no reason to allow the ad to be given absolute pre condition to achieving the sustainable independently by vocational training and adult education increase in quality that is needed this does not mean that institutions will make it possible for part of ad programmes all the efforts of the universities of applied sciences must in to be provided in vocational training and adult education the short term be focused on the creation of for example location under the integral responsibility of the university new short tracks for students with pre university education of applied sciences just as happened in sub round of qualifications professional master degree programmes the ad pilots this involves at most the first half of the ad or associate degree programmes however it is such differentiation that must determine the image of the ad will thus remain part of the professional higher professional higher education in the future for that reason education bachelor degree but will receive more the government explicitly wants the universities of applied independent profiling within that degree programme sciences that already deliver high quality education to instead of ad holders automatically qualifying for transfer engage in the differentiation of education to the subsequent phase in the bachelor degree system of will be introduced associate degrees pilot projects with associate degree programmes have made it clear that the associate degree ad fulfils need of employers the ad offers students the opportunity to make motion submitted by de and van der ham the possibility substantial step in their career for some professional to investigate whether to allow secondary vocational education higher education students often students who have establishments to independently offer associate degrees house of representatives no transferred from secondary vocational education or people this will offer the universities of applied sciences the room study performed by at my request has to properly develop the labour market qualifying function shown that major factor in the choice of pre university of the ad new subsidised ad programmes will exclusively students for academic higher education is that pre university be instituted if their relevance to the professional field has educated students and their environment have the been demonstrated with macro efficiency check the impression that professional higher education represents existing availability of company training schemes will also lower level than academic higher education the recent be scrutinised it is not the intention that universities of media attention around professional higher education applied sciences should offer such programmes in the will only reinforce this impression in the short term future under the banner of an ad besides investing in the broad quality of professional higher education more challenging learning tracks must be created the ad will not take shape across the board in professional for pre university educated students in professional higher higher education in view of the extent of this type of offer education to this end in this government term of office in other countries realistic expectation is that the ad will ensure that alongside the excellence tracks mentioned could grow to share of the total bachelor intake in the previous chapter the uas will be able to offer short in professional higher education by particularly three year professional higher education bachelor degree non subsidised education potentially still has plenty of tracks for pre university educated students and more room for expanding the range of ad programmes the professional master degree programmes the academic associate degree committee has assessed the ad pilot titles will also be adapted see below applications in recent years pre condition for positive assessment by this committee was positive verdict by will make it legally possible for universities of applied the on the quality of the requested ad programme sciences to offer three year bachelor tracks to pre shall ask the associate degree committee in consultation university educated students pre university educated with the the netherlands association of universities students enter professional higher education with more of applied sciences the the mbo raad and the mental baggage can do more work in less time and employers organisations to draw up plan of approach can thus attain the bachelor exit level more quickly for the expansion of the subsidised and non subsidised to adequately challenge these students it is good to associate degree offer to stimulate sufficient ad provision demand more from them in the above mentioned study will include an independent diploma payment for the by students in the sixth final year of ad in the subsidy system furthermore will also ensure pre university education and first year university students that new ad programmes may also be started in the period were asked how professional higher education could be before the entry into force of the amended ad legislation made more appealing to pre university educated students to that end we will organise an extra pilot round ad short tracks and tracks focused on higher exit level were at programmes that started in the previous pilot rounds will the top of their wish list for that matter three year track lose their pilot status with the change in the law and in is not possible with all programmes for arts programmes anticipation of this will have the opportunity to register for example pre university education prepares new students in the academic years and students for the intended exit level of the programme making professional higher education more professional master degree programmes appealing to pre university educated for the labour market it is important to have more students professional master degree programmes the netherlands currently pre university educated students who are interested has relatively few programmes at the master level in high level professionally oriented education often opt number of professions for which professional bachelor for programme in academic higher education rather than exit level used to be sufficient have developed such that professional higher education programme this must there is now need for graduates at master level this change pre university educated students seeking applies to the teaching profession for example but also oriented programme must be able to choose to nursing where in recent years nurse practitioners and from good range of programmes if more pre university physician assistants have been successfully introduced educated students enter professional higher education employers want to be able to train their employees up to this will in addition alleviate the pressure on academic master level in recent years the number of professional higher education and give the research universities more master degree programmes in the education and health room to strengthen the academic nature of academic higher care sectors has already expanded substantially the education the quality of professional higher education government wishes to expand this number in other sectors must be increased across the board to make professional higher education more appealing to pre university educated students an increase in the number of professional master degree are enrolled in professional higher education programmes on offer could encourage pre university furthermore over of professional higher education educated students to opt for professional higher education graduates engaged in some form of international mobility pre university educated students faced with their programme during their studies the academic titles must be geared to options know that in many cases transferring to research international standards in line with the recommendation university is the only way for them to earn master degree of the committee the current legal distinction in academic titles between professional and academic higher in view of the limited financial resources for master education will be abolished the of arts and of degree programmes the government has opted for science will no longer be exclusively reserved for academic phased roll out of subsidised professional master degree higher education programmes they may also be used by programmes the government is initially aiming at an graduates of professional higher education programmes expansion of the number of professional master degree for which these are customary in the international programmes in the top economic sectors the requirements perspective this could also increase the appeal of for professional master degree programmes are that professional higher education to pre university educated they arise from clear labour market demand which students for example is identified in the top teams action in the future however by no means all professional higher agendas education programmes will qualify for the of arts they are inter related with practice oriented research and of science with the degree the institution must select that is being done at university of applied sciences an affix such that it fits in with the type of programme in they match the profile of the university of applied the accreditation initial accreditation procedure the sciences and the focus areas in education and research will check the academic titles proposed by the institution chosen by the university for suitability in the international context the academic they do not result in suppressing existing private titles may only be employed after the has found them programme offers to be suitable reference list of internationally recognisable they are complementary to the academic higher programme specific degrees for each sector will serve as education master offer in the sector and have clear guide for the checking of these by the and as oriented focus guideline to the universities of applied sciences has in the meantime drawn up draft version of the reference list the present criteria for professional higher education master programmes in the macro efficiency policy by changing the academic titles the government does regulations will be adapted in line with these requirements not have the express intention of abandoning our binary with effect from the expansion of professional system with the committee the government master degree programmes in the top sectors will be recognises the importance of the distinction between funded from the residual budget of the closed down subsidy professional higher education and academic higher scheme for post graduate professional higher education education the government however shares the notion of master degree programmes the following phase of the the committee that debates on have wrongly roll out of professional master can take place when the intervened in debates on appropriate titles this is why we have universities of applied sciences have instituted three year opted to change the academic titles in the near future tracks for pre university educated students the universities the distinction between universities of applied sciences of applied sciences can institute these three year tracks and research universities will remain internationally from the four year funding that they receive for their visible on the diplomas and in the diploma supplements pre university educated students then use part of it for universities of applied sciences may not call themselves the expansion of their range of professional master universities but universities of applied sciences the degree programmes will make focused performance government will see to it that institutions properly conform agreements with the universities of applied sciences to their legal obligation to issue diploma supplement about this see chapter academic titles with the ideas in this and the previous chapter we are working hard on the quality and image of professional higher education in the netherlands the international position of professional higher education students and graduates and the appeal of professional higher education to foreign students also require that we change the academic titles of the foreign students in the netherlands committee two examples from the draft reference list higher art education comprises about bachelor programmes there are three programme specific degrees the bachelor of music the bachelor of education bed and the bachelor of fine arts bfa the music programmes are concluded with degree the teacher training programmes with bed programmes that are focused on the visual arts and do not belong in the teacher training sub sector can be concluded with bfa degree the remaining programmes qualify for the bachelor of arts degree ba higher economic education includes about bachelor programmes most of the programmes about three quarters can be concluded with ba there are two programme specific degrees in this sector bachelor of business administration bba and llb bachelor of laws programmes that can be concluded with bba degree are business administration technical business administration and business administration and management programmes that qualify for the llb degree are the professional higher education law and higher law programmes the programmes that largely focus on accountancy finance informatics and communication systems qualify for the bachelor of science degree bsc and reduces the risk of their dropping out this is why it is also good to increase the range of broad based bachelor programmes available in academic higher education in academic higher education broad based bachelor programmes can furthermore contribute towards more solid academic education different variations of broad based bachelor programmes are conceivable programmes academic higher education more profile with only broad based first year but also programmes that in the range of programmes only specialise at later stage there are already good examples of broad based programmes in academic higher education liberal arts colleges have been established at various research universities of which the university colleges are successful examples however these are residential small scale and intensive in nature and therefore reach only in academic higher education various steps have already very small proportion of the student population for that been taken in recent years to achieve restructuring of reason the government believes that broad based bachelor the programmes on offer good case in point is the programmes of supra disciplinary nature must be organised humanities where the range of master programmes rather than programmes that are based on residential or has been reduced from to broad based ones the liberal arts concept committee report has also emphatically been seized upon by the research universities to collectively continue to work on and selective renewal an interesting example is the university of twente of the range of programmes the research universities are this university is carrying out comprehensive aiming to provide each region with coverage of all the restructuring of its range of programmes starting major bachelor programmes mutual from in addition to yet to be constructed among the research universities should in addition increase university college and the already existing technical the efficiency of the programmes on offer among other medicine programme it will offer nine broad based things fewer small programmes for the master phase bachelor programmes instead of the present the research universities want to tie in with the research twenty two smaller ones within the nine broad focus areas and the demands of the labour market as shall based programmes students can further specialise explain in chapter intend to conclude an outline via majors agreement with the research universities in which will give them the room to achieve further profiling and reduction of the range of programmes this room is not open ended it is crucial that students doing broad based bachelor however the research universities will have to account for degree have access to sufficiently wide range of master the results they achieve in addition institutions that make degree programmes within the broad based bachelor sharp choices in their programme offer or are able to therefore the student must have sufficient room to specialise further reinforce their profile will be rewarded for the master the range of broad based bachelor degrees must furthermore be developed in cohesion with the range of in the outline agreement will make agreements with the master degrees preferably via approach research universities about the desired developments in the range of academic programmes this involves reduction of in the macro efficiency rule suitable criteria will be the range but also broader based bachelor programmes included to stimulate the range of broad based bachelor more profiled academic master range and more diversity programmes in addition the institutions will have the in the research programmes will explain this below opportunity to introduce broadened programmes for three years during this period they will not lose the right to offer broad based bachelor programmes in the parent programmes of the broad based bachelor academic higher education again this is in case it turns out that in academic higher education it is also important to for example would be more efficient as an independent have more broad based bachelor programmes for many programme students the study choice is problematic because they either do not yet know what profession they want later or which studies chime best with their professional interests starting with broad based programme and increasingly specialising within that programme can help these students more profile in academic higher education theses of dutch research master are at the master degrees top level academic higher education master degree programmes in the netherlands viewed both nationally and within the individual research universities need more profile and theses by research master students score better in the same more independent position with regard to academic higher disciplines than the theses of students enrolled in regular education bachelor programmes differentiation has master degree programmes the theses of regular master increased with the introduction of research master degree programmes are assessed as very satisfactory to degrees nonetheless it is wise more than ten years after good but the quality of the research master theses is the introduction of bachelor master system to closely assessed as good to excellent students in such programmes examine the range of programmes once again many rank among the international top according to assessments master degree programmes are defined by the learning by panels of international experts at the behest of the outcomes of the bachelor programme rather than by accreditation organisation of the netherlands and flanders harmonising with the labour market students also indicate in the framework of the international thesis that the academic higher education master degree does assessment study the expert panels assessed theses in not always properly prepare them for the labour market total from research master and from regular master while the professional perspective is an important within the same subject areas argument for choosing master degree programme the research universities must therefore invest more in source www net gearing their master programmes to the needs of the labour market give institutions the choice of no longer offering follow on master degree programmes exactly because of the focus for institutions larger units such as graduate schools or that follow on master degree programmes have on professional schools law medical or business schools connecting with the bachelor these programmes generally provide opportunities for profiling they are more visible have little profile in this way the academic higher education and give the institutions programming latitude by amending master will receive more exposure as an independent the regulations the government wishes to facilitate larger programme abolishing the mandatory follow on master units within and between institutions though naturally not also more conscious choice of study by students at the cost of small scale education collaboration between this is also important for that reason the law will be research universities can raise their profile and at the same amended on this point the point of departure for the time increase the efficiency of the master programmes on government is that even if the mandatory follow on offer such collaboration is already occurring more and more master is abolished there are always possibilities for the research universities in the randstad for bachelor graduates to follow master degree example work closely together to provide number of programme small master degree programmes for modern languages some research universities the technical research abolishing the mandatory follow on master will also universities for example have jointly organised national mean that there must be clear admission requirements and master degree programmes there is also collaboration that master degree programmes must be accessible to with foreign institutions also in the form of joint degree wide range of bachelor programmes bachelor graduates programmes these are excellent developments must always have opportunities to follow master degree programme with some professional or academic bachelor moreover it is important that institutions gear their degrees graduates will still need to follow transfer master degree programmes to the profile of the university programme or pre master programme before they can primarily its research profile master degrees must be embark on the master of their choice for example more in line with the research focus areas of the institution because several subjects that are essential to the master this applies to the research master as well as the other programme are lacking in the bachelor programme more master degree programmes academic master degrees collaboration between related programmes of research that are more focused on the labour market gain in strength universities and universities of applied sciences can limit through having an optimum connection with the research the necessity for transfer programmes have noticed that conducted by the institution in the previous period lack of clarity has arisen about the costs that research university can charge students for but that is not all profiling the master programmes also eliminating their deficiencies clarity on this point is means looking at the overall including education necessary shall therefore amend the law transfer profile of the institution and making choices in the range programmes to my mind are programmes that take at most of master degrees in that light the government wishes to six months ects it must be possible in maximum of six months for this adjustment of the system through which phd institutions to provide students with sufficient baggage to is earned is also more in line with what is customary join the master degree programme also want to avoid internationally and in europe this will make it easier unnecessary amounts of time being scheduled for transfer for foreign phd candidates to switch to dutch research programmes if certain bachelor graduates really do need universities and increase the appeal of the netherlands more than ects programme to do master degree this in my eyes no longer involves transfer between bachelor and master in such cases the university may charge higher tuition fees will legally arrange that students can follow transfer programmes of maximum of six months ects for the statutory tuition fees for programmes taking longer than six months more than ects institutional tuition fees apply the law will be amended to this end more variation in research training the government also wants more diversity in research training in international terms the netherlands has relatively few researchers although we definitely need them first of all for science and for research positions in companies but also in the public sectors such as education particularly in secondary education and professional higher education more phds are needed to meet the higher demands of professional practice the current budgetary framework sets limits on the number of researchers that can be trained annually more differentiation in the doctoral system can help to increase this number will therefore make it legally possible for research universities to introduce doctoral candidates with student status scholarship students distinction is thus made between appointed doctoral candidates providing education and scholarship students with student status following extra education the choice for one of the two positions must be substantive and cannot be based solely on the labour market situation applicable to the different sectors research universities can choose their own profile scholarship students are cheaper for institutions than doctoral candidates with employee status because no taxes have to be paid for scholarship students expect that the use of scholarship students will leave the research universities with an additional sum of around million to spend on the education of phd candidates thus they can make approximately more positions available per year than without making use of scholarship students pre condition for making more use of scholarship students is that there is no meddling with the high quality of dutch doctoral theses all doctoral theses remain subject to the existing high requirements set by doctorate boards eua based on rug programmes want to change this will investigate whether making different arrangements for part time education in the higher education and research act whw is advisable the whw investigation will be part of wider inquiry into the match between the supply and demand of part time education private providers of higher education will also be expressly involved flexibility in higher education for the secondly am currently exploring possible of workforce student grants and loans as an incentive for lifelong learning the question is whether students other than those currently entitled to student grants or loans should also have the possibility to apply for grant this concerns students thirty years old and over in higher education and secondary working people are still not served in dutch vocational education part time students and students higher education even though more updating retraining following second higher education study programme and further training is needed the labour market is after all in addition the government is investigating the possibility becoming more mobile even for higher education to put into effect the advice of the ser to expand the fiscal graduates the social and economic council ser explicitly facilities for schooling and education decision making states this in its advisory report on the strategic agenda once on this will take place in the context of the memorandum in the labour market it remains necessary to continue to learn and duurzame long term employability which develop to remain employable over the long term the ser therefore will be submitted to the house of representatives shortly advocates further of lifelong learning as an important condition for long term employable labour market population in shall facilitate institutions that wish to expressly focus view of the need for higher education graduates there must on the target group of working people they will receive furthermore be sufficient opportunities for those who work on the basis of the innovation article in the whw the to follow higher education in the netherlands the facilities room to experiment with forms of education that match provided for lifelong learning have not yet been fully the needs and attributes of people who work this could be developed they mainly lack the flexibility that is especially for example combinations of learning and working or the necessary for employed people this is illustrated by the organisation of flexible learning routes this will enable us decline in the range of and enrolment in part time study to create new programmes for those who are working and programmes in higher education identify any unnecessary legal impediments in the experiments the institutions can continue to build on the the government sees it as its responsibility to encourage the experiences gained in the meantime with the pilot projects availability also at higher education level of high quality for lifelong learning in professional higher education programmes for the workforce this is why have opted for the definite introduction of the associate degree and number of private providers of higher education have expansion of the number of professional master degrees expressed the desire to offer only parts of certain higher the introduction of the national qualification framework education programmes this usually concerns the last two is also relevant to those who work it increases the years this is now legally impossible they must offer the transparency of the non formal range of programmes and whole bachelor programme however such flexible provides insight into the level of the qualifications that can programme track could be interesting for certain groups be attained within these programmes of working people for example those entering teaching from another career background or students who have to achieve flexible and high quality education for those already finished study programme and wish to broaden who work will remove impediments in legislation and it by following top up course for this reason will regulations shall further inform the house of investigate whether the whw can be amended on this point representatives about this at the end of first of all for private providers without the quality of want to provide room for more part time programmes in the diploma in any case it is conditional that the quality of sectors where this is needed currently the macro efficiency the procedure for admitting students remains undisputed policy provides no room for new part time programmes in in its recommendations regarding the strategic agenda disciplines that already comprise great many full time the ser pointed out the importance of further advancement and utilisation of recognition of prior experiential learning rpl rpl could shorten the study duration for people with ser work experience and thereby lower the threshold for employees to go back to school shorter studies furthermore lower the cost of programme for the employee or his employer the government regards better assurance of the quality of rpl as crucial to encourage its use at the end of will therefore submit an rpl bill to the house of representatives this bill covers rpl across the board and therefore involves standards for secondary vocational education higher education and recognised non formal trade programmes furthermore in parallel track the government will make agreements with the trade unions about further encouraging the use of rpl am assuming that the higher education institutions will also do their bit by collectively providing adequate rpl procedures the open university ou has recently been considering its future position and profile in the lifelong learning market and in dutch higher education this has resulted in draft strategic plan for the ministry of education culture and science ocw and the ou have in the meantime jointly asked an international review panel under the chairmanship of prof dr van der wende to assess this plan on that basis will make agreements with the ou and the other providers of distance learning about the position of the ou in the future higher education system will do this partly in the light of the range of distance learning provided by the other public and private higher education institutions the future positioning of the ou must not lead to the unnecessary displacement of private offers the house of representatives will be informed about the results of the consultations this autumn the government is conducting labour market analyses labour market relevance will become criterion in the funding of new programmes the range of professional programmes will be restructured and knowledge bases will be developed in professional higher education in cohesion with the professional field what are we going to do employers will also make more active contribution to higher education through on the one hand better articulating their needs for higher education graduates and their educational needs to the educational institutions and on the other hand by creating internships and scholarships the importance of making sharp choices in the range of for students and by seconding subject teachers courses on offer and more differentiated higher education programmes and practice oriented research that match the have been the central issues in this chapter the government needs of the professional field will be stimulated in is aiming for focused manner examples include the ad programmes the professional master and the centres of expertise more efficient and more profiled range of programmes sector plans are supported in sectors struggling with labour the government is encouraging the educational market shortages for example the physics and chemistry institutions to substantially restructure their range of sector plan the tus sector plan and the engineering programmes by making agreements with them to this technology sector plan for professional higher education end outline agreements and holding the institutions to the government is launching feasibility study into labour account the outcomes of the analyses by the top teams market indicators for the benefit of the new funding system of the top sectors will where relevant be involved in this restructuring more differentiation in professional higher education furthermore the committee for efficiency in higher the associate degree will definitely be instituted education will periodically analyse the existing three year tracks in professional higher education will range of programmes in sectors where this is necessary be made possible for pre university educated students the institutions may involve these analyses in the profiling the academic titles for professional higher education will of their range of programmes the analyses foster be geared to the customary international academic titles appropriate agreements with the institutions on the there will be more room for professional master and reduction of their range of programmes broad based bachelor degrees in the efficiency policy the macro efficiency policy will be redesigned to match our ambition for more compact range of programmes more differentiation in academic higher education and more profiling new policy regulation will provide for there will be more room in the efficiency policy for more room for broad based bachelor and broad based bachelor degrees professional master degrees the mandatory follow on master will be abolished independent testing of the associate degree programmes larger units such as graduate or professional schools new criterion for profiling in the macro efficiency will be facilitated when need be check applications for new programmes must in institutions will have the opportunity to deploy future match the profile of the institution scholarship students an explicit criterion in the macro efficiency check with regard to the needs of the labour market especially flexibility in higher education for the workforce with the ad and the professional master degree unnecessary legal impediments will be removed more room will be created for part time programmes greater labour market relevance of higher education in sectors where this is needed the government is working on enhanced labour market institutions will receive room for experimentation information for the efficiency agenda and student study the law will be reviewed on the points of part time options in the information material about the range of education tuition fees loans and the provision of top programmes on offer to students programmes by private providers information will be included about the professional profile legislation will be developed to guarantee the quality of rpl and the labour market prospects of the programme such as chances of job at the level of the programme job search duration and average starting salary research more profile more impact the research landscape of the future has larger number of specialist knowledge clusters in these clusters research forty nine questions for science universities universities of applied sciences research institutes companies civil society organisations and the government besides identifying the great social and innovation work together intensively in fields of research within top themes pioneering curiosity driven research sectors and regarding social

elementary particles way more quickly and easily into new products and services to the cosmos thus the agenda links scientific top talent from home and abroad finds its way more easily economic and social challenges and shows how they to the research focus areas of the knowledge institutions are inter related because the research landscape is more highly profiled this landscape will not develop spontaneously but will require considerable effort from all parties concerned it also requires even sharper choices of institutions regarding what they will do and especially what they will not do any more the netherlands with of global knowledge production is sizeable player but we are also relatively small country we cannot shine at everything and we must make optimum use of our scientific strengths the institutions are expected to take solid steps in continuous process of further developing research focus areas the institutions are also expected to enter into more intensive collaborations all this requires an open window on the knowledge society of the st century above all profiling contributes towards further reinforcement of the science and economy sectors that constitute the strengths of the netherlands so that our country can compete internationally this requires focus on the top economic sectors to significant extent the programming of research in the netherlands will focus on the themes brought in from the agendas for the top sectors key elements are demand driven education and public private collaboration outside the top economic sectors focus and mass are also needed to excel internationally to this end there must be sufficient room for fundamental free and unfettered research in the dutch scientific community the curiosity of scientists is the basis for breakthroughs in scientific research this requires optimum deployment and utilisation of instruments this also applies to research in disciplines other than those that are relevant to the top sectors or social challenges excellent curiosity driven research is the basis for many innovations and social renewal it is the goose that lays the golden eggs which must not be slaughtered scientists can obtain inspiration from the nederlandse dutch science agenda which was recently published by the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences see the box nowt knaw may in addition to high quality research facilities and intensive the humanities the expansion of methods for public interaction with the stakeholders our system needs private collaboration demand driven programmes and passionate scientists well educated people constitute the more focus on valorisation are significant factors public most important output of the system this means that our private collaboration is high on the agenda of many top scientific talent must be given room and that the teams not only with regard to research but education as institutions must pay attention to talent policy and hrm well for example in the centres of expertise and the centres policy talent is an important production factor after all for innovative craftsmanship the education provided by therefore expect the institutions to regard talent policy as research universities and universities of applied sciences an important policy instrument am thinking of tenure must also align with the top sectors in order to prepare our track systems and profiling by concentrating top talent knowledge workers for the future the talent programmes of the netherlands organisation for scientific research nwo ensure room for research talent public private collaborative ventures bring companies allocating funds to these programmes on competitive knowledge institutions and the government closer together basis ensures that the funds end up with the best they constitute the foundation of the trade and industry researchers have asked the nwo to integrate the different policy of the government the government regards talent lines public private collaboration as promising route in various fields in recent years various successful collaborative the top economic sectors have an interest in high quality ventures have been built up the technological top science but also in greater impact of scientific research institutions are good case in point if companies and increased utilisation of the knowledge developed within the collaboration indicate where they invest in profiling can make significant contribution to this nwo then the rest of the chain from fundamental to applied will give more priority to valorisation among other ways research and education can capitalise on this the result by employing impact as full criterion in the acceptance must be greater active commitment from companies the of research proposals science is of essential value for our ultimate goal is more innovation public investment is economic success the top economic sectors approach leverage for private effort to guarantee the innovative constitutes an extra challenge for science no longer climate the standard bearers have proposed the introduction business as usual the assignment is to optimise the use of generic fiscal facility for this proposal has been of science as the fuel in the pipeline from knowledge to positively received by the government therefore in the learning to cash register in the top sectors approach the coming months when such an arrangement is integrated business community government and scientists compile into the fiscal agenda attention will be paid to its knowledge agendas for the innovative sectors in which the effectiveness european law and budgetary aspects and netherlands is already strong and in which we wish to implementation costs remain strong if we focus our efforts and gear the profile of the research landscape to this goal our country can further profiling of the research landscape is also needed develop into society that can manage international with an eye to an even greater contribution from science competition by using its brains it is good to see that our to our society and the issues it is faced with the grand national science priorities it nano technology and challenges in europe are an increasingly important basis genomics are from now on guaranteed in the top sectors for the definition of large scale research and innovation programmes it is important for the dutch knowledge the agendas of the nwo and knaw will be aligned with the world to capitalise on this and make the most of the integral agendas for the top sectors as much as possible financial opportunities that europe offers this requires the nwo and knaw will deploy million from their profiling on research domains that are essential for social research resources on the basis of the knowledge agendas challenges such as energy and water shortages food supply for the top sectors and the commitment of the business the aging society public health food safety and community nwo top sectors funds the research that global warming this involves not only the science and nwo finances from this budget ties in with the priorities technical disciplines the social sciences and the humanities of the top sectors the nwo and knaw will deploy their are also expected to make solid contribution the top resources on the basis of scientific quality and impact economic sectors for that matter also make significant it must be borne in mind that for example the institutes contribution to these social themes the grand challenges of the knaw largely operate within the social sciences and are also opportunities for the top economic sectors to make see the policy response to the strategic plans of the nwo and knaw see memorandum el ocw eu proposal green book on socially house of representatives no strategic framework for eu funding of research and innovation com parliamentary paper no money social challenges are not always in line with the finally in flourishing knowledge economy science and top sectors approach that is why in their profiling process an inquisitive attitude are firmly embedded in society the knowledge institutions must also pay attention to often citizens have confidence in scientific results and expertise multidisciplinary research that is needed to overcome these for example in debates about vaccination or climate social challenges change they put scientific findings above the opinions of non qualified experts for scientists and their institutions to increase the impact of research and optimise the utilisation this means they must make an active and co of its results it is essential to strengthen the integral knowledge contribution to knowledge communication and education chain the pipeline from fundamental to applied to practice but also give citizens access to the latest state of scientific oriented research and innovation furthermore collaboration insight to this end the proper provision of scientific between employers and knowledge institutions must be information if possible on the basis of open access is very strengthened as must the efforts directed at the valorisation of important in knowledge society the data and results of knowledge and stimulating entrepreneurship among students publicly funded research must be easy to find and accessible and researchers it is important for universities of applied to all the knowledge institutions are therefore expected sciences to strengthen practice oriented research so that they to optimise accessibility receive more self evident place in the innovation system in the following sections will set out the measures with regard to profiling research in academic higher education and harmonising with the top sectors agendas and the the green knowledge chain european research and innovation agenda including the quality assurance of research the green knowledge system connects academic impact and utilisation of research valorisation higher education professional higher education technological and technical scientific research private secondary vocational education and pre vocational capital for research entrepreneurship scientific secondary education not only to one another but communication and access to scientific information also to research from this connection knowledge practice oriented research in professional higher is quickly to education in its role of education including the raak programme and public knowledge centre it knowledge for private joint ventures such as centres of expertise stakeholders via the educational institutions or via arrangements in order to enable them to apply this knowledge in practice professional practice and knowledge gained from experience is brought into the school through interaction with these stakeholders this system does not operate alone but also works with education and research players from other fields of knowledge on cross themes this results in up to date programmes and the use of current knowledge higher agricultural education hao plays an important linking role in the knowledge chain together with wageningen ur the hao institutions are working on further profiling and the transition to knowledge centre on the basis of the hao sector plan from the philosophy science for impact the green knowledge co operation facilitates the dissemination of knowledge by operating joint facilities for the whole green knowledge system the programmes on offer at the top research schools should closely match their research focus areas the institutes of the netherlands organisation for scientific research nwo and knaw will also have to play an active part in the process of profiling the scientific knowledge landscape they will need to form strategic alliances with profiling research in academic those research universities whose profile matches the national mission of these institutes the on campus higher education accommodation of the institutes contributes to clustering and profiling as we see in utrecht around the laboratory or in eindhoven around the energy research by the nwo institute for fundamental research on matter fom annual agreements are made about the formation the government wants to use its term of office to achieve of alliances between the para university institutes in the further profiling of our research landscape together with administrative co ordination with nwo and knaw not the institutions below describe what expect of the only the science and technical institutes will be involved institutions sharp choices by institutions must ensure but also institutes that focus on the humanities and social further profiling of our national research landscape this sciences at the same time expect the research universities is needed to remain among the top in the world in several to give collaboration and the formation of alliances with fields also expect the institutions to opt for solid the institutes firm place on their profiling agenda substantive research profile but the institutions will also have to collaborate and so emphasise their profile more finally the process of profiling that envisage must strongly with one another with research institutions and comprise adequate checks and balances profiling must with companies not take on such powerful form that smaller subject areas important to our country fall by the wayside the process all the research universities will have to strengthen their of profiling may not result in the occurrence of blank spots scientific profile through the development of research the knaw will have to play role in monitoring this with focus areas and by collaboration in alliances the aspiration continuous critical reflection on the functioning of the is that every university will belong to the world top in national cohesion of the system as whole some fields at least it is also my intention that the research universities should visibly contribute to the top economic sectors and grand challenges in the coming period the research universities are therefore requested to carefully and collectively examine their research and compile list financial boosts for profiling of their individual strengths in the association of universities in the netherlands will use this to make the coalition agreement states that the sum of million proposals for farther reaching profiling in research which will be allocated for research resources during this will be implemented in at the latest these proposals government term of office for this purpose the sum must demonstrate how the research universities collaborate of million will be cut back from the publicly funded with other knowledge institutions national research research universities and universities of applied sciences on institutes and with companies in the top sectors and the basis of their proportion of research the second flow how they are capitalising on social challenges chapter of funds will be cut by million the resources released indicates how the process around research profiling by this cut are earmarked for further profiling of the will be implemented research landscape in relation to the top sectors total of million clear relationship must be established there must be good balance between education related with the agendas of the top sectors in the outlay of these research research that is driven solely by scientific curiosity resources and research that is driven by economic and social issues this also applies to the contingent flows of money to reinforce the impact and valorisation of research sufficient room must be created for fundamental research million is earmarked for the technology foundation outside the top sectors profiling in research must therefore stw see section and another million for practice in any case involve choices in the range of phd and research master programmes see the policy response to the strategic plans of the nwo and knaw parliamentary paper no oriented research in professional higher education see for large research facilities the increased amount may section furthermore will continue the impetus of be immediately included in this procedure as may the the previous government of million for the physics knowledge agendas from the top sectors policy which were and chemistry sector plan drawn up as result of the trade industry memorandum if this investment is to pay off then good it research allocation of the million infrastructure is essential the science of the early st century is characterised by passion for data and data large scale research facilities million euros overload this applies even more to research facilities including it research infrastructure million euros which will simply generate more digital data all scientific reinforcement of sectors and applied research every knowledge institution and arts and social sciences million euros every facility is highly dependent on the quality of the the humanities million national it infrastructure and on it research up to now the netherlands has had leading role in it infrastructure top research schools million partly thanks to surf this position must be retained stw million for that reason the increased budget for the large research practice oriented research facilities will have to be used to reinforce the national it in prof higher education million euros research infrastructure with an amount increasing to million per annum plan has been drawn up under the direction of nwo for the various basic components of because the above sums can only be spent once sharp the it research infrastructure networks high performance priorities have been set and we have investigated what extra computing visualisation grids advanced data storage and investment would have the greatest effect on the further facilities for science the resources will be used via the profiling of the research landscape on the quality of the nwo to realise this plan research and on the top sectors my first priority is investment in large scale research facilities because they provide reinforcement of sectors intense research focus areas and have good opportunities extra resources will be earmarked to strengthen number for collaboration with the business community and civil of science sectors in the arts and social sciences the society organisations the nwo budget for this purpose will inter relation between education and research must be be doubled additional investment is also needed in the arts enhanced their contribution to the big social challenges and social sciences with an eye to improving the inter must also be strengthened additional resources are needed relationship between education and research but certainly for the humanities sector plan to tackle fragmentation and also with an eye to their contributions to social challenges smallness of scale research in physics and chemistry must more will also be invested in the sustainable humanities also be reinforced this concerns the basic sciences as well sector plan expansion of the in depth strategy for top as the importance of physics and chemistry for the business research schools should ensure that new top research community schools which are able to make sizeable contribution to the top sectors approach and the grand challenges the problems occurring in the arts and social sciences will appear on the basis of national competition arise from the highly variable student numbers fragmentation into relatively small research teams and large scale research facilities including the little opportunity to attract third flow funds the previous it research infrastructure government made start with the reinforcement of these investment in large scale research facilities ensures the areas million will be made available for research in concentration of top researchers they must be able to work these fields this sum in accordance with the allocation with world class facilities large research facilities are also formula agreed in the canada agreement will be used to significant catalyst in the profiling process investing in this resolve the problems in these domains and to strengthen type of facility creates hot spots of economic activity and the position of the younger research universities expect talent investment in large research facilities is therefore the institutions to use these resources to strengthen the an important priority in the profiling policy of this inter relation of education and research and give government the existing nwo budget of million for significant boost to research focused on resolving social large research infrastructure will therefore be increased by challenges such as security and social cohesion the million per annum in the meantime the nwo has financial crisis or pension security also expect the already been asked to update the national roadmap institutions to use these additional resources to enhance the inter relation of education and research house of representatives nr thus am also implementing the lucas motion of distribution between the chambers namely one chamber december to discuss more balanced distribution for exact and technical sciences one chamber for biomedical of research funding among the research universities with sciences and life sciences and one chamber for arts social the association of universities in the netherlands sciences will earmark sum of million for this on top of the existing million that was already available this sum of million has been earmarked for the humanities additional budget must result in the profiling of university these resources are intended for the further elaboration top research that contributes to the top sectors or to of the sustainable humanities sector plan by the regional research in the field of the grand challenges in the eu body these resources must be used to combat framework programme will ask the nwo to develop fragmentation and detrimental smallness of scale in an assessment procedure that does justice to the knaw number of the fields of study in the humanities among recommendations as well as the top sectors policy of other things by increased among the this government and which allows us to tie in with the humanities faculties european research agenda the two schools qualified as exemplary will continue to be funded from the depth the goal of the physics and chemistry sector plan is to strategy as long as they still qualify as such the four other strengthen university education and research in physics and top research schools can compete again in the procedure chemistry this is important for the business community to be developed by the nwo but also to strengthen the basic sciences increase the intake of students in the programmes and boost their success rates structural sum of million per year will be made available from existing resources with effect from of which million will be allocated via the ten faculties quality assurance of research of physics and chemistry the remaining million will be divided among researchers by the nwo cw area council alongside financial incentives supporting sharp profiling for chemical science and fom in competition or spent choices calls for an adjustment of the quality evaluation of on the purchase of large equipment research on number of points this requires adjustment of the present working methods of the knowledge top research schools in the top sectors institutions and the standard evaluation protocol first bigger budget will be available for top research schools of all the national of similar research teams in line with the so called depth strategy this will boost the must be improved this is needed for the overview of connection between the top research schools and the grand national strengths that the institutions must collectively challenges outlined in the eu framework programme produce for an objective assessment of this overview we but also their connection with the top economic sectors need to be able to establish what our strengths are based top research schools started in after strict selection on factual information at this time however national on quality and have been evaluated very positively several comparison is not really possible it is further times since because of their contribution to the national clear how the institutions implement the recommendations co ordination of excellent research based on these positive of evaluation committees in addition many of the evaluations the selected top research schools have always evaluations do insufficient justice to the specific been continued during the last evaluation in two of characteristics of number of fields of science such as the the top six research schools nova and received technical and sciences and the humanities the predicate exemplary and four the predicate excellent finally insufficient concern is shown for the valorisation in the impending rigidity in the top research schools of scientific knowledge see below will discuss these instrument induced then minister plasterk to ask the knaw objections regarding the quality assurance of the research to advise on obtaining greater dynamics in the instrument and in the protocol with the institutions involved the knaw advised doubling the budget and proposed association of universities in the netherlands nwo and assessing the plans for top research schools in three knaw the strategic plans of the individual institutions chambers with the object of broadening their spread will have to indicate more clearly how they follow up on the across the developing scientific fields am broadly recommendations of evaluation committees adopting the advice of the knaw but would like different lucas motion concerning balanced distribution of research funding among research universities house of representatives no house of representatives no the profiling plans of the institutions will also be viewed expressly in the light of the european agenda for research european research agenda and innovation the profiling in the dutch research landscape must properly the universities of applied sciences also participate in the connect with developments in european research policy so competition for european research funding although that european research and innovation resources have an practice oriented research is still in development in optimal effect on our national efforts european comparison with scientific research embedding research investment is needed for projects that exceed the national is an important goal in professional higher education too level to prevent fragmentation and duplication of effort practice oriented research contributes to higher quality and boost cross border collaboration of education and to collaboration between universities of applied sciences and the business community in the the proper cohesion of national research policy with european context the netherlands will also draw attention european policy is also important with an eye to achieving to the importance of investment in practice oriented good return on our eu contribution dutch researchers research particularly for the innovative power of small have already been able to obtain high return out of the and medium sized enterprises framework programme for research and technological development of the budget for the first half of the th framework programme went to dutch researchers against reasonably expected percentage of therefore think it is crucial that institutions are and remain able to match the european contributions against the background of declining government resources this will require sharp choices by the institutions the government is advocating frugal eu budget but within this tighter budgetary framework sufficient resources must be released to invest more in research and innovation increased efforts must be expended on themes with big social and or economic impact with more attention paid to demonstration activities and the development of prototypes in addition extra budget resources must be allocated to the european research council erc for free and unfettered research and for capital market instruments focused on risk capital as well as loans in short national and european priorities must be properly aligned and our national ambitions for higher education science and innovation will have to tie in closely with the european agenda proper consultation with parties involved from science higher education and the business community should ensure sufficient dutch influence on the european agenda on the other hand european developments will have to find proper place in national policy this is why the government has asked to include the european agenda in the further development of the top economic sectors when drawing up the agendas for each top sector see el ocw memorandum eu voorstel over een strategisch kader voor eu financiering van onderzoek en innovatie com eu proposal green book on collective strategic framework for eu financing of research and innovation com parliamentary paper no in addition making better use of fundamental and practice oriented research requires strengthening of the whole knowledge chain environments in which education research and application come together induce students to develop their various talents to the full and to test which career suits them best researcher knowledge worker professional or independent entrepreneur their environment must utilisation and impact of research challenge them for researchers it is also desirable that they commit to social challenges and immerse themselves in the possibilities of the application of new knowledge this increases support for research and the chances of attracting private capital the impact of research must increase and new knowledge ensuring that the results of research find their way to must be converted into innovation sooner it may no longer innovation more readily calls for an active valorisation take seventeen years for an improvement in health care policy entrepreneurship and an entrepreneurial attitude to become visible establishing start up business by an must be actively encouraged in higher education on the entrepreneurial researcher may no longer be regarded part of the business community more courageous as inappropriate the connections between companies investment in knowledge development could be considered governments civil society organisations and knowledge institutions must become much stronger only through valorisation strong collective operation can these players in the the utilisation of knowledge must be optimised research netherlands overcome the international competition universities must become entrepreneurial institutions with other knowledge economies researchers must also become more entrepreneurial we will initiate actions in several areas to strengthen results from scientific research must find their way more valorisation the utilisation of knowledge and embed easily into innovative products processes and services it in the dutch structure the government is supporting the collaboration in the golden triangle government development of professional entrepreneurial pipeline knowledge institutions and the business community from entrepreneurship education and fundamental research via the top sectors approach is the appropriate route up to and including the incubation of new companies this our research must also make greater contribution to will take place both in and outside research universities and the social challenges universities of applied sciences by initiating new economic activity within the existing business community this requires far reaching public private collaboration between knowledge institutions companies and social firstly valorisation will play more prominent role in the institutions in recent years various successful collaborative knowledge institutions both the economic and social projects have been set up the technological top institutes utilisation of knowledge it involves the utilisation of are good case in point it is exactly these collaborative knowledge from all domains the medical and technical projects between companies knowledge institutions and domains for example but also the arts and social sciences the government that bring the players closer together and domain and the fine arts valorisation must assume solid ensure the international profiling of strong knowledge position in knowledge institutions and high quality clusters more structural embedding in the knowledge implementation in the government knowledge landscape of this type of public private collaboration is institutions and employers agreed how to tackle this in the desired valorisation agenda kennis moet knowledge must circulate at the end of the ministries of economic the development of research focus areas in academic higher affairs agriculture and innovation el and education education and professional higher education must contribute culture and science ocw launched valorisation to reinforcing the connections between research education programme and made million available and regional employers this gives rise to more natural as once only impetus to facilitate the embedding of inter relations between the partners in the knowledge chain entrepreneurship education screening and scouting the latter is visible in science parks like the bioscience park in of possibly knowledge the protection of leiden and the high tech campus in eindhoven for example knowledge in order to communicate it the support of spin off companies and the formation of networks of companies and knowledge institutions among other things the goal is for the knowledge institutions to embed the this is why we are working on job profiles for valorisation facilities for valorisation in structural and self supporting staff and reinforcing the quality of these personnel manner in the meantime the universities of delft twente the government will ask the national valorisation tilburg utrecht and wageningen as lead agencies of their committee which monitors the implementation of the respective in which companies and universities valorisation agenda for advice on what more is needed to of applied sciences also participate have together received realise the goal around million for these valorisation activities private capital for research and innovation immediately after taking office this government launched in his response to the reports of the top teams the programme to ensure that we convert more knowledge into minister of economic affairs agriculture and innovation new products and services the aspiration is that from remarked that companies in the top economic sectors have or as much earlier as possible or more of public difficulty obtaining capital for risky innovative activities research resources will be used for the benefit of converting the government has therefore decided to earmark the sum knowledge into innovations in the outline agreement with of million in this government term of office for an the research universities shall make agreements about the innovation fund for small and medium sized enterprises output goals to be achieved in line with the valorisation plus mkb with the fund the government wishes to agenda knowledge must circulate assist innovative entrepreneurs in finding funding for innovative projects that cannot be completely financed furthermore valorisation will definitely be included as an through the market the point of departure is that this risk evaluation criterion in the quality control for research capital will be paid back from successful innovations so indicators will be formulated in order to monitor the efforts that the available resources can be used for other innovative expended for valorisation such as the number of patents projects in the coming years the innovation fund will and rights that have been marketed numbers of start ups be completed in steps in it will amount to almost contribution to employment opportunities and the amount million by it will have grown to million of private investment this means doubling of the current resources for innovation loans for small and medium sized enterprises this is also will further ask the knowledge institutions to pursue an big opportunity for the knowledge institutions they can work active policy of stimulating and rewarding scientists and together with private initiatives on research projects researchers for their valorisation efforts this can be done by adaptations in hrm policy such as hiring policy besides the innovation fund announced above the introducing flexible hours wherever necessary comeback government intends to ensure that more risk capital becomes guarantees and including valorisation in performance available in the coming term of office to this end the interviews government will explore how rules and other impediments can be tackled in order to create opportunities for wider use other options are incentives in the remuneration system of venture capital in research and innovation the government such as taking account of companies started up by will also ensure that more knowledge about research and employees and other valorisation activities the division of innovation is communicated to capital providers this can income from spin offs and setting up joint doctoral tracks be done by increasing transparency or by establishing an with companies in the outline agreement with the research expertise centre for example universities shall also make agreements about hrm policy directed at valorisation finally it is high time that technology transfer policy in the netherlands was this means uniform policy for intellectual property and technology transfer office that has mandate to do business on behalf of the university valorisation professionals are also needed see el memorandum van het nieuwe house of representatives no naar de top outlines of the new business community policy to the top parliamentary paper no in higher education for example more and more students venture capital wish to become entrepreneurs in of students versus in the accreditation organisation of the venture capital provider with clear dutch structure netherlands and flanders is developing distinctive could have huge positive effect on innovation in the feature for entrepreneurship for higher education netherlands this is the missing as it were for programmes at the request of the government institutions capital in the chain of knowledge learning capital can use this to support their profiling in the near future cash register pension funds can play part in this and the house of representatives will receive policy document are doing so more and more often both the abp on the promotion of young entrepreneurship which national civil pension fund and the pension will also outline the state of affairs with regard to fund for employees in health welfare and social entrepreneurship education institutions are involved financing risky knowledge and innovation tracks does not at first sight seem to technological and technical scientific be an obvious option for pension funds nevertheless research capital from pension funds often ends up in the successful valorisation calls for stimulating scientific financing of dutch research or dutch technology research with concrete applications in practice the development indirectly in those cases the capital approach used by the technology foundation stw is runs via venture capitalists often from abroad which generally viewed as best practice besides the criterion of in turn sometimes finance dutch research excellence stw employs the criterion of utilisation and they always have supervisory committee in which the business community or other users participate experience more intensive and sustainable collaboration between with this has shown that only high quality research results knowledge institutions and companies for example in in high quality valorisation stw has been able to provide the campus concept can contribute to more fortitude and this high quality and at the same time ensure that research willingness to invest private capital in research research is converted into concrete applications the stw budget will universities and universities of applied sciences could be be increased by million to strengthen the valorisation of more entrepreneurial in this area and pay more attention technological and technical scientific research will ask to obtaining private funding for scientific and applied stw to develop procedure based on an increase in the research this provides opportunities above all for research budget for valorisation subsidies and in line with the top with clear innovative impact sectors approach nwo will also expand its activities for valorisation via stw and the valorisation grant nwo will finally the utilisation of philanthropic contributions furthermore include utilisation as full criterion in the private individuals companies funds to research can assessment and acceptance of research proposals in this also be improved an active and entrepreneurial attitude is way valorisation is already guaranteed up front expected from institutions on this point the government will support this development by making successful science communication and access to formulae visible here link with the grand social issues is scientific information obvious the high impact of research requires not only something of the researcher but also from the user of new knowledge entrepreneurship in knowledge society at the level aspired to by the for the innovation application and marketing of knowledge government the average citizen has high degree of general an entrepreneurial attitude is needed in students and knowledge and an inquisitive attitude citizens have researchers especially starting young companies and confidence in scientific expertise and can distinguish it entrepreneurial employees turn out to have positive from regular opinions for example in debates about influence on economic growth and innovative strength vaccination or climate change this confidence begins the previous government therefore made over million with familiarity with science and thus with scientists available to support entrepreneurship and free enterprise in educational institutions from primary education up to and for this reason the social importance of science must be including higher education professional higher education highlighted and confidence in science must be reinforced and academic higher education the evaluation report therefore expect the institutions to take an active stance received by the house of representatives shows that in communication about science and seeking more mutual positive steps have been taken in recent years to stimulate collaboration science communication will be nationally entrepreneurship in educational institutions supported with subsidy to the dutch centre for science and technology communication house of representatives no this is intended for the nemo science centre for other regional science centres and for activities like october knowledge month together with ocw nemo is working on different design for the knowledge month more co ordination is desired to obtain greater impact for the different science and technology communication activities confidence in science and its integrity is simultaneously pre condition for public support for investing in science will ask the knaw for advice on the question of how the integrity of and confidence in science can be advanced by policy measures free and sustainable access to scientific information is likewise of great importance to promote confidence in science this offers citizens the opportunity to become familiar with research results not only interested citizens but also professionals outside the knowledge institutions such as medical practitioners and entrepreneurs in the sme sector thus improving the accessibility of the results of scientific research will make significant contribution to valorisation an increasingly better educated population can also handle greater degree of information the netherlands has leading position in making scientific knowledge accessible we must take advantage of this lead the institutions involved knaw association of universities in the netherlands mbo raad nwo the royal library and the university libraries vno ncw and the scientific publishers are working intensively together on optimising the accessibility of the results of publicly funded research underwrite the initiatives in the field for open access to the results of publicly funded research this also applies to european initiatives for open access to research results under the th framework programme applaud the initiatives of scientists who publish the results of their research in open access journals mutually making available research data between researchers is an important element re

oriented research carried out at universities assessments focus not just on the quality of the research of applied sciences connects education and employers but also on the significance of the research for education small and medium sized enterprises and the semi public and professional practice the validation reports show that sector and stimulates innovation in professional practice proper embedding of associate professors and research is practice oriented research also plays an important role within the top sectors it frequently fulfils linking role represented in the innovation alliance association founded in between fundamental scientific research and the business november are vno ncw mkb nederland the netherlands community an important instrument for practice oriented association of universities of applied sciences tno and research is the raak regional action and attention for knowledge circulation programme public private depending on the needs of the top sectors

research funding rewarding quality and profile new dynamics in the steering of higher education less focus on student numbers in the funding of higher education and more rewarding of quality and profile that is one of the key recommendations of the committee concentration on quantity has been at the expense of quality sharp profile choices by research universities and universities of applied sciences are needed to achieve higher quality and greater for students and employers profiling requires more room for selection and tuition fee differentiation as indicated previously this chapter focuses on the design of the profiling process and the necessary changes in the funding model it has already been more than year since the committee report was presented the report has received broad support this must now be transformed into an irreversible movement in the desired direction the recommendations of prof dr and prof dr van the working group on profiling and funding provide an elaboration of this theme from the report of the committee the working group on profiling and funding rightly argues for combination of bottom up and top down initiatives in the profiling process the institutions have the first move but the government must assess whether the desired system gains have been realised in terms of quality improvement and efficiency to this end the working group has made proposals for adjustments in the funding and process surrounding and strategic plans steered by process director will adopt significant elements from this recommendation but some components find too massive and in risk of unnecessary bureaucracy emphasise clear responsibility for the results achieved via performance agreements working group on profiling and funding institutions choose their own profile and tie in with the government research universities and universities of applied sciences must not wait for one other or the government but commence discussions themselves this was also the call of the committee what is the profile of my institution what type of students do have and how can points of departure for best guide them with which institutions do wish to benchmark my ambitions and achievements what strategy the profiling process is necessary what priorities should choose and which programmes and research lines will drop the map classification gives an initial overview of the existing profiles of institutions the classification can help institutions to search for comparable institutions with among the research universities the committee which they can mirror themselves the government expects report has resulted in concrete intentions to develop research the strategic plans drawn up by the universities of applied and education focus areas via regional alliances professional science and research universities to tie in with the long higher education is also taking profiling initiatives for term perspective for higher education and research outlined example with the sector plans for the northern netherlands in this strategic agenda for fine and performing arts programmes and for higher education in agriculture will build on these initiatives and sector plans are an important link in the conclude outline agreements with the association of profiling process universities in the netherlands and the netherlands sector plans are proven effective means of combining association of universities of applied sciences hbo raad strengths restructuring the range of programmes and in which research universities and universities of applied developing research focus areas at the national level sciences commit to goals and performances to be achieved it is also good way to involve peers and stakeholders such as reducing the number of programmes and linking new style sector plans as advised by the working group on master degree programmes to research focus areas profiling and funding therefore constitute an important the dutch system is already characterised by significant link in the profiling process amount of profiling in academic higher education profiling has developed primarily as result of the dynamics in quality and profile will become significant research but each university historical origin has also made elements in funding an impression on the content and nature of the research and quality and profiling will be rewarded in the funding of study programmes available professional higher education higher education firstly performance agreements will also features high quality profiled institutions but at the be made with all the institutions on quality study success same time the current problems in professional higher profile related aims and objectives and valorisation education show that broad improvement in quality is secondly want to selectively allocate extra resources needed to the development of supra institutional research focus areas and profiling for these two elements the committee and the working group on there will be quality and profile portion in the funding profiling and funding use convincing and broadly model amounting to about of the education budget in shared arguments for the acceleration and deepening this government term of office after further elaboration of the profiling process profiling leads to from this portion could increase to around of to choices for subjects that people are good at which is the education budget number of other countries are also very important also for the reinforcement of an considering increasing the performance related share institution generic quality in addition profiling of education funding the netherlands is at the forefront contributes to differentiation in education and reducing however with our choice to link substantial part of fragmentation of the range of programmes on offer the funding to quality sweden has recently introduced the development of focus areas in research and education modest form of generic quality funding of the budget leads to combining strengths which makes it possible to is shared among the institutions on the basis of the highest overcome the increasing international competition scores in the quality evaluation in an initial profiling is also necessary to gear the education provided evaluation of this funding model will become available to the top sectors and social challenges employ the following points of departure to increase the pace of the profiling process intensity higher success rates lower dropout rates especially in the first year reduction of the overhead when this contributes to the primary process reduction in the range of programmes on offer developing focus areas and of institutions in the field of education in context with research the introduction of broad based bachelor degrees and strategic choices for the long term more collective national master degrees developing research focus areas of institutions in the areas of research focus tying in with top sectors and social challenges the grand challenges of the eu and the development of sector plans enhancing the utilisation and impact of research the profiling process is aimed at comprehensive stimulating and rewarding institutions scientists and of the higher education system this requires researchers for valorisation efforts among other things process that takes years of consistently and logically modification of hrm policy and joint doctoral tracks keeping to the chosen path initially want to give the research universities and universities of applied sciences pre conditions the opportunity to manage this process and get it off the the outline agreement will also comprise pre conditions ground as much as possible however it also requires an for which the government will assume responsibility to independent assessment of the pace and returns with the facilitate the process these are for example long term goals in mind and at some distance from the legislation and regulations concerning selection actual political administrative discussion section registration date for the benefit of study options should the assessment give cause more active manner interviews abolishing the mandatory follow on of steering the process will be applied master tuition fee differentiation and the reduction of administrative burdens latitude in macro efficiency assessments if institutions in consultation arrive at and off programmes or the development of broader based quality and profiling in academic higher bachelor degrees education and research reduction of administrative burdens in the management of research and education such as elements in the the research universities have indicated that they will funding regulations subsidies control and collectively and individually commit to an outline accountability agreement on the desired developments in academic higher for number of large scale majors in the arts and science education and research such an outline agreement gives sector the research universities want to regulate the the sector itself the lead in the collective process of research incoming students in order to increase the quality and focus development and more efficient organisation of the efficiency of the education the possibilities for range of study programmes on offer this is in line with the qualitative selection will be expanded in this on going initiatives of research universities to achieve government term of office for the following period strategic alliances it is also in line with the autonomy and we shall have to review whether further agreements are good performances produced by the research universities necessary with regard to the method of funding especially in research but the agreements are not open ended and they demand clear accountability accountability the government will in turn discuss the necessary pre hereby delegate the responsibility for progress conditions with the research universities the intention is co ordination and mutual of the process to to conclude an outline agreement at the beginning of this the collective research universities this creates obligations autumn preparations for this will take place during the before the summer of will receive report from the summer association of universities in the netherlands on progress in reducing the range of programmes on offer and the aims and objectives development of focus in research this report will also the outline agreement with the research universities will present concrete goals to be achieved by focus on four main topics along with their national aims and objectives via this outline agreement the research universities are enhancing quality and study success higher educational committed to common goals and results to be achieved for the entire academic higher education sector in addition require little more preparation time in any case want to rules and indicators will be established for the performance make agreements this autumn in an outline agreement with agreements with individual institutions subsequently the universities of applied sciences with regard to the agreements will be made with each university about following aims and objectives concrete performances and accountability at the increasing the quality of education upgrading the level institutional level the institutions will give account of teachers more master graduates and phds external regarding their performance by way of the statutory validation of testing and examinations and strengthening strategic plans and annual reports the knowledge bases of programmes how will this take shape via which approaches to national and collective testing what steps will be taken to achieve broad implementation across the entire professional higher education sector which fields of study will have quality and profiling in professional higher priority education reduction of the number of programmes development of sector plans the universities of applied sciences have also announced increasing quality and study success higher educational that they wish to arrive at an outline agreement in which intensity higher success rates lower dropout rates they collectively and individually commit to performance especially in the first year reduction of overhead where agreements with regard to quality and profiling the this contributes to the primary process further entry emphasis is placed on securing and increasing generic requirements in connection with the transfer of students quality more so than the research universities the from secondary vocational education more attention collective efforts of the universities of applied sciences devoted to research skills in the curriculum will primarily be focused on the external profiling on three year and honours tracks for pre of diplomas strengthening the knowledge bases of university educated students associate degree programmes and reinforcing testing practice testing programmes centres of expertise and professional and examinations must be externally validated for each master degrees programme by making use of national testing of one or more core subjects or by using external examiners if accountability national testing is not feasible the knowledge bases will be hereby delegate the responsibility for the progress strengthened via approach naturally employers co ordination and mutual of the process will be closely involved these developments must be to the collective universities of applied sciences before the combined with reduction in the range of programmes on summer of will also receive progress report from offer realise that the more oriented character the netherlands association of universities of applied of professional higher education makes different demands sciences this will focus on the progress made with regard on the diversity in the range of programmes than academic to reinforcing the knowledge base the national or higher education for the universities of applied sciences collective testing of core subjects the differentiation of the this is huge challenge which goes largely beyond the range of programmes and the reduction of the total number individual institutions it is therefore necessary for the of programmes broader based bachelor the report will professional higher education sector to join forces also propose concrete goals to be achieved by another reason why an outline agreement with the the universities of applied sciences are committed via universities of applied sciences is opportune concerns this outline agreement to common goals and results to be differentiation in professional higher education this is achieved for the entire professional higher education sector necessary in order to cope with the highly diverse student in addition rules and indicators will be established for the population concrete implementation of differentiation performance agreements with individual institutions means further agreements about the national roll out of subsequently agreements will be made with each university the associate degree programmes honours programme of applied sciences regarding concrete performances and and three year tracks for pre university educated students accountability at the institutional level the institutions centres of expertise and professional master degree will give account regarding their performance by way of the programmes this is what profiling in professional higher statutory strategic plans and annual reports education should be specifically focused on the discussions concerning an outline agreement with the the changes in the funding model are powerful incentive universities of applied sciences are more recent than those for universities of applied sciences to pay more attention to with the research universities for that reason the outline quality and profile improving quality can thus be rewarded agreement with the universities of applied sciences may before institutions qualify for extra money the generic quality must be in order section the sector plans in professional higher education will also play significant role section private providers this strategic agenda is for the most part related to government funded higher education however privately funded education providers also play significant role currently around students are enrolled in an accredited higher education programme at one of the private universities of applied sciences that are affiliated to the umbrella organisation this mainly concerns part time education for people who are working will make agreements with the about the contribution private providers can make to the aims and objectives in this strategic agenda striving for more quality and increasing the flexibility of education for working people also concerns the private providers for them the lifelong learning market is of primary interest the private providers handle substantial portion of the demand for education among the workforce as elaborated in section an exploratory study will be conducted into part time education based on this study further agreements can be made about ways in which the private players can contribute to the necessary growth of lifelong learning in the netherlands in turn will consider where the government can play supporting role dependent on the availability of additional resources from the run up of the intensification resources from to million will be implemented anyhow on the basis of experience to be gained in the coming years we shall consider whether these resources will be deployed via competition or as part of the performance agreements with bonus malus system furthermore in the evaluation quality and profile in funding of the performance agreements will consider if and how indicators for valorisation can be further involved in the funding of research and education performance funding in line with the outline agreements will conclude new modification of the funding system is necessary in order to multi year agreements with the individual institutions by facilitate sharp choices in profiling and reward institutions june at latest experiences in recent years with the that produce high quality the first priority is improving the collective agreements on quality and study success at branch quality and study success in education focusing on level show that the subjects mentioned were indeed high on bachelor programmes performances in research are good the agenda in many institutions yet collective agreements and the competition for research funding is already huge do insufficient justice to the differences in effort and so the necessity to modify the funding system for research is performance between institutions in addition individual less pressing furthermore million of research funding agreements have the advantage that account can be taken will be in this government term of office to of the context the student population and the ambitions support the profiling process this is why we have opted to of each institution concentrate the modifications in funding on the education budget nonetheless will provide incentives to increase the utilisation and impact of research where there is goals in the performance agreements progress still to be made the new agreements focus on concrete goals in in this government term of office quality and profile relation to the following subjects component will be introduced in the funding model dropout especially in the first year as indicated in amounting to around of education funding to this chapter will take account of the risk of increased end the resources will be deployed in the context of current dropout when the bar is raised collective multi year agreements approx million study duration success rates plus the reinvestment of resources from the coalition quality assessments from the accreditation process agreement which increase from million in to education intensity face to face hours staff million in in total this involves million student ratio in as result the student dependent portion of the teacher quality funding will become relatively smaller reduction of overhead where this contributes to the primary process will distribute the largest part of the quality and profile resources on the basis of performance agreements with the goals are based on limited number of individual research universities and universities of applied indicators institutions may also choose additional sciences focused on quality and study success in addition indicators that are of interest from the viewpoint will also allocate portion selectively million on an of their own strategy annual basis in the period from to inclusive thus intend to stimulate the development of focus areas and profiling in education will also make agreements with each institution about performances in the area of profiling in mid in which after an evaluation and further elaboration the proportion will take the experiences gained with the performance for quality and profile in the funding in could agreements regarding quality and study success into increase to of the education budget over time this is consideration the concrete goals presented by the possible if the evaluation in shows that modification association of universities in the netherlands and the of the funding system has clearly had positive effect on netherlands association of universities of applied sciences the quality and profiling of education this run up to in the progress report on the outline agreements will serve especially intended to further expand profiling is partly as starting point furthermore will make performance agreements on selection and valorisation with individual strengthening excellence by learning from the success institutions with the latter the valorisation agenda is factors of the sirius programme leading the intentions for these subjects will be included in the the efforts and performances of the institutions will be strategic plans and must be part of an institution wide and assessed in subsequently in redistribution preferably supra institutional strategy the strategic plans of resources will take place via bonus malus system must comply with the criteria in the advisory report of the the assessment is based on the scores with regard to the working group on profiling and funding as shown below indicators in combination with an audit of the efforts the and supplemented on several points institutions have produced all aspects together constitute balanced scorecard and lead to considered judgement in the assessment of the results achieved will criteria for strategic plans determine the amount of bonus malus in will develop this approach via adjustment of the funding model the plan designates the profile of the institution on the basis of proven strengths in education research encouraging the development of focus and valorisation long term aims and objectives areas and profiling and the subsequent progress to be made up to and all the universities of applied sciences and research including universities must in the coming years indicate in their the plan indicates how it contributes to the desired strategic plans what choices they are making for sharpening development perspective for dutch higher their profile in education and research each institution education and research as outlined in this strategic will do this based on its own mission and strategy so that agenda for higher education research and science the approach is in line with the type of institution they want and the agendas of the top sectors to be and the type of students the institution has and wants each plan contains proposals for differentiation in to attract both the committee report and the education according to type of offer and level recommendations of the working group on profiling and in any case in the bachelor phase funding point out that such process requires some effort the plans show where efficiency gains are or have therefore will give institutions the opportunity to acquire been achieved that increase the quality and extra funding via selective allocation for the development international appeal of education and research by of national focus areas and profiling it is obvious that they harmonising with the conclusions of available should harmonise their efforts with the goals formulated in sector plans the outline agreements positive experiences have been making supra decisions at institutional gained with such an approach in the sirius programme and level setting clear priorities but where necessary in the centres of expertise in professional higher education phasing out parts of education and research or accommodating them elsewhere in consultation for professional higher education this will in any case with other institutions involve the selective allocation of resources for collaboration between the institutions and in dialogue public private collaborative projects such as the centres with the environment the business community and of expertise which are primarily related to the top sectors social organisations is preferred because it facilitates and are embedded in strong regional clusters with the and the development of focus areas business community and other knowledge institutions professional master likewise initially focused on the top sectors proposals possibly from collaborating institutions that stimulation of the broad development of associate degree comply with the above criteria and best tie in with the stated programmes as well as honours tracks and three year desired developments qualify for extra funding see section programmes for pre university educated students for the role of the review committee in this this is paid out annually as part of the lump sum in the period from for academic higher education it in any case involves continuation lowering or raising in the period support for alliances between research universities from depends on the results achieved by each directed at developing focus areas and international institution as remarked earlier will earmark sum of excellence million for this extra funding on an annual basis from to inclusive further steps in will evaluate the modifications to the funding and consider how further steps can be taken towards stronger link between funding and performance this mainly concerns the issue of how further reaching quality incentives can be introduced in the funding system the results of the feasibility study into labour market indicators for the benefit of the new funding system will be taken into consideration in this the expansion of the quality and profile portion of the funding to of the education budget sector plan approach requires great deal of effort from all concerned this is why in this government term of office have opted for selective approach where in any case the following priorities will apply do the reports regarding the top sectors provide motivation to adjust on going or launch new sector plans sector plans existing sector plans and on going initiatives such as fine and performing arts programmes the collaborating universities of applied sciences in the northern netherlands education education science green education and the teacher training programmes will be continued sector plans are an addition to the approach described above firstly because in many cases focus areas in addition the decision to make new sector plans will and will have to be developed at regional only be taken on the basis of thorough problem analysis national and european levels secondly sector plans the government and the sectors can both take the initiative pre eminently offer the chance for subject experts to deliver to develop new sector plans the progress reports from their contribution more distanced from institutional the association of universities in the netherlands and the interests researchers teachers and professors associate netherlands association of universities of applied sciences professors and finally the sector approach allows could also provide motivation for new sector plans stakeholders to be closely involved the professional field the business community and civil society organisations shall make resources available in this government term of office to strengthen education and research in the dozens of sector plans have been drawn up in recent years following sectors humanities the de boer committee sector investment plan arts sciences and humanities at the research universities centres of expertise physics and chemistry which have technical research universities and stw also been successfully implemented but agree with the top sectors large infrastructure sector plans centres conclusions of the working group on profiling and funding of expertise master in professional higher education that thorough problem analysis and broader approach top research schools at the research universities is necessary for new sector plans will adopt the strict er requirements for new style sector plans proposed by the working group requirements for sector plans precise intentions regarding and concentration of existing or future facilities focus on the long term and based on empirical evidence independent and expert assessment and international benchmarking deal with education and research and the utilisation thereof and where relevant with academic and professional higher education and public and private education reasoned from outside to inside aligned with the needs of society and professional field tie in with developments in the european higher education area and the european research area as far as the research universities are concerned seek connections with extra university institutes see the advisory report national plan for education education in any case where educational consequences sciences from the committee for the national plan for future phd master are involved education sciences and the policy response to this house of representatives no independent review committee both the committee and the working group on profiling and funding underline the need for some form of independent direction of the profiling process the committee pointed out the government system responsibility and invites it to take up that responsibility more vigorously the working group on profiling and funding states that it is inevitable that the steering relationship between government and institutions will become less generic in nature more emphasis will be placed on arrangements between the government and groups of individual institutions the government has set out clear course in this strategic agenda want to first give the research universities and universities of applied sciences the opportunity to design the process but will closely monitor that the necessary pace and the desired system gains are achieved will appoint review committee with an independent chairman to this end within the framework of the strategic agenda and always under the political ultimate responsibility of the minister it will fulfil the following tasks monitoring the profiling process through annual reports to the minister advising the minister on the selective allocation of resources for profiling section this also includes guidance and support of the profiling process in institutions assessment of the progress reports of the association of universities in the netherlands and netherlands association of universities of applied sciences in do the reports provide sufficient perspective on achieving the gains of the profiling process as envisaged by the committee and the working group on profiling and funding have the sector plans been sufficiently utilised evaluation of the profiling process and advice in on the manner in which it should be continued this review committee will be composed of national and where necessary international experts and representative from the business community the committee will be appointed before january what are we going to do reinforcement of quality and profile will be tackled in combination of bottom up and top down elements wherever possible we will tie in with initiatives of the institutions themselves the funding system will be adjusted to foster the process profiling and quality of institutions in their strategic plans institutions make strategic choices focused on profiling and quality improvement these are with the development perspectives for higher education and research outlined in this strategic agenda an outline agreement will be concluded with the association of universities in the netherlands and the netherlands association of universities of applied sciences initially the sectors will take responsibility for achieving the established goals in academic higher education this involves study success developing focus areas and reduction of the range of programmes on offer in professional higher education it concerns quality improvement and reinforcing the knowledge base study success differentiation and of the range of programmes on offer before the summer of concrete goals will be established which must be achieved within this government term of office will make agreements with the about the contribution private education providers can make particularly with regard to higher education programmes for the workforce an independent review committee will see to it that the profiling process proceeds at the necessary pace and that the desired system gains are realised where necessary sector plans will be drawn up these will have to comply with new strict requirements funding of quality and profile an increasing proportion of the funding will be allocated to quality and profile in this government term of office we will start with around of the education budget this will be distributed on the basis of performance agreements with institutions on quality and study success bonus malus part of the budget is intended for speeding up the profiling process key points of this strategic agenda this strategic agenda outlines long term perspective for higher education research and science our aim is future proof higher education system system with international allure in which students are challenged teachers are enthusiastic and researchers contribute to scientific breakthroughs the resolution of grand social issues and increasing our economic success the triangle of research education and entrepreneurship is the foundation of our prosperity collaboration within this triangle strengthens the earning capacity and capacity for economic growth in the netherlands dutch research is good to very good but the utilisation of research must be radically improved demand driven approach will bring research and entrepreneurship closer together valorisation will be much more explicitly on the higher education agenda than before in the trade industry memorandum the government has outlined its approach to making the netherlands more innovative more changes of direction entrepreneurial and more competitive its nine top sectors approach is central to this the government wishes to reinforce the competitive strength of the sectors of water agro and food horticulture and source materials high tech life sciences chemistry energy logistics and the creative industry in the golden triangle of the business community the report of the committee on the future sustainability knowledge institutions and government agendas have of the dutch higher education system been drawn up with actions that are needed to keep the committee has persuaded the government and the whole sectors on the international map the agendas were field of higher education that comprehensive changes of presented on june according to the direction are needed to increase quality across the board in recommendations of the top sectors public private higher education the committee states that we collaboration between education research and government will not achieve the ambition of ranking among the top five on the one hand and the business community on the other most competitive economies in the world if we continue on is vitally important this strategic agenda contains powerful the same footing dutch higher education has to improve lot and support for the top sectors approach in the trade improve quickly the drop out rate is too high talent is not challenged industry memorandum to be issued in september the enough and there is too little flexibility in the system to properly serve government will indicate how the top sectors approach will the varied needs of students and the labour market and yet be translated into the programming and organisation of the research universities and universities of applied sciences knowledge system are having to fight for their positions in an increasingly international context that is highly competitive in nature the advice from the committee is add powerful impetus to improving the quality and diversity of dutch higher education moreover the quality of professional bachelor degrees is no longer undisputed doubts have arisen about the quality of the diploma this government has already presented its proposals on this point committee house of representatives no committee see the policy response to the final report alternative graduation tracks parliamentary paper no dropout rates will be reduced and success rates will be increased graduating within the standard timeframe must become the rule and not the exception the foundation for this will goals for the present government term be provided by improving the interface between secondary and higher education reinforcement of the quality of the of office exams in general secondary education and secondary vocational education also priority in this government term of office and more attention for better performing students in secondary education will improve the quality it is crucial that irreversible steps are taken now this of the students entering higher education furthermore government is focusing on the following aims and good match between student and study programme is objectives essential to this end the government is committed to improving the information provision career orientation and study options guidance will be expanded with more information about quality professional profile and labour market perspectives the bar will be raised the broad implementation of study options interviews and advancing registration dates finally of course the education will become more intensive more will be above mentioned measures concerning the intensification demanded from students the goal is more ambitious of education and an ambitious study culture are crucial study culture agreements will be made with each institution about student staff ratios number of face to face hours programmes with fewer than ten face to face hours per week will belong to the past and the percentage of students participating in excellent education the target profiling reinforcing labour market is by to get the right students in the right places relevance more differentiation the possibility for selection on admission will be expanded selection furthermore increases the motivation and efforts results in higher quality and greater of students thus selection contributes to better for students and employers institutions performances and more challenging study culture will have to focus more on their strengths and phase out tuition fee differentiation will be made possible for more weak programmes and research disciplines such profiling expensive excellent tracks will also result in efficiency gains and reinforcing our international competitive position more broad programmes teachers are the standard bearers of education quality will be developed and the number of programmes will be particularly in professional higher education better severely reduced employers will play greater role which equipped teachers are badly needed the goal is that means more recognisable professional profile for study will have master or phd by with final goal of programmes and more attention for shortfall sectors by the bar can only be raised in professional higher education once the basics are in order this is by no means the quality problems in professional higher education are the case everywhere the value of diploma may never be partly caused by the very diverse group of students that must open to discussion supervision will be reinforced to be served simultaneously this is why clearer distinction guarantee the quality of diplomas in addition all will be made in the programmes on offer for different target professional higher education programmes will reinforce groups in professional higher education the development their knowledge bases and ensure that testing and of associate degree programmes appealing tracks for examinations are externally validated to this end each pre university students and professional master degrees programme will have to make use of national testing on one in academic higher education this primarily entails or more core subjects or if national testing is not feasible broadening the bachelor programmes and more profiling deploy external examiners in the master degrees on offer across the board in higher education more flexible tracks are needed for working people development of research focus areas sharp choices are also needed with regard to research to achieve further profiling of our national research landscape the research universities will have to vigorously continue the process of research focus development scientific quality and impact are the most important criteria for the development of these focus areas they will have to tie in with the top sectors the grand challenges in the th framework programme and the institutions own scientific strengths research universities will have to join forces with one another with research institutions and with companies the aim is that every university will belong to the world top at least in some fields the development of focus areas will have an effect on the range of research master and phd programmes the nwo and knaw institutions will be involved in this profiling process with an eye to the desired clustering the impact of research on the economy and society will increase collaboration in the knowledge chain particularly in the top sectors new knowledge must lead to innovation sooner science is the fuel in the knowledge learning cash register pipeline collaboration in the golden triangle knowledge institutions the business community and government via the top sectors approach is the appropriate route public private collaboration is high on the agenda of many top teams collaboration in the knowledge chain of fundamental research practice oriented research applied research and innovation will be stimulated the government moreover wishes to consider how rules and other impediments can be tackled to allow wider use of venture capital valorisation must be structurally embedded in policy and by institutions and researchers the position of practice oriented research at universities of applied sciences will be consolidated in the knowledge system in addition profiling and valorisation will become significant elements profiling is badly needed both to achieve the restructuring of the study programme range and for enhancing the development of focus areas with regard to the top sectors another million will be selectively allocated for fostering profiling and excellence what are we going to do with million for performance agreements and million for selective allocation the quality and profile component amounts to of the regular education budget in this government term of office number of other countries are also considering enlarging this strategic agenda contains large number of measures the performance related share of funding the netherlands to be implemented in this government term of office to is at the forefront however with our choice to link such achieve these goals substantial portion of education funding to quality sweden has recently introduced modest form of generic quality funding of the budget is shared among the institutions based on the highest scores in the quality evaluation funding boost the experiences in this government term of office will be utilised to make the criteria and indicators more robust the government is investing an amount increasing to so that the quality and profiling share can quickly increase million for the intended quality boost in this period if extra resources become available in subsequent period to this end the savings produced by the study completion the profiling and quality component is intended to grow delay measure and the introduction of the loan system in to of the education budget the master phase will be in higher education performance agreements will be made in about the use of these resources with individual research universities and universities of applied sciences with regard to quality study success and profiling outline agreement and performance agreements with individual institutions also from the sum of million will be and used to advance profiling in research large scale intend to sign an outline agreement with the association research facilities are an important catalyst in the process of universities in the netherlands and the netherlands of profiling the assessment procedure for top research association of universities of applied sciences this autumn schools will be geared to both the top sectors policy and the in which the higher education sector commits to performance european research agenda the stw budget will be increased agreements with regard to quality and profiling chapter for enhancement of the valorisation of technological and it has been agreed that will receive report from the technical scientific research furthermore the arts social association of universities in the netherlands as well as the sciences sectors and humanities will be reinforced netherlands association of universities of applied sciences before the summer of on progress in reducing the range of programmes the development of research focus areas reinforcing the knowledge base and the development of national and collective testing in professional higher rewarding performances with respect to education these reports will also contain proposals for quality profile and valorisation concrete aims and objectives to be achieved by fundamental change in the financing of higher education these collective agreements to which the individual will be implemented entirely in line with the institutions commit themselves lead to better performances committee report instead of the current focus and accountability at the institutional level with regard to on student numbers research universities and universities quality study success and profiling performance agreements of applied sciences will be increasingly funded on the basis will be made with individual institutions in mid in of performance this in any case concerns the quality of the the efforts and performances will be assessed subsequently education supplied good performances will be rewarded and the resources will be via bonus malus system lagging performances will also have budgetary consequences this gives the research universities and universities of applied sciences the opportunity to first manage the process education research and science leads to powerful support themselves however will expressly see to it that the for the top sectors approach of this government necessary pace and the desired system gains are achieved to the agendas for the top sectors must be taken into this end review committee with an independent chairman consideration in the profiles of knowledge institutions will assess the reports of the association of universities in the this will be verified in the assessment of strategic and netherlands and netherlands association of universities of sector plans applied sciences in and advise me on them if necessary nwo and knaw will bring their plans as far as possible will tighten the government steering role in the process in line with the integral agendas of the top teams million of their research resources will be deployed on the basis of the knowledge agendas for the top sectors and the commitment of the business community significant part of the million from the programmes will be geared to the labour research budget will benefit the top sectors million market stw plus considerable portion of the million for large infrastructure and million for the top research higher education will be more responsive to the needs of the schools labour market to this end the government is working on the focus areas in the raak programme tie in with the better labour market information for the benefit of the top sectors efficiency agenda and the study choice of students in the depending on their needs centres of expertise will be information material on the range of programmes on offer instituted for each of the top sectors in professional to students information is included about higher education the professional profile and labour market perspectives of million is available for professional master degree the programmes such as chances of job at the level of the programmes in the top sectors programme job search duration and average starting salary furthermore labour market relevance will be valorisation will be embedded in the knowledge institutions criterion in the funding of new programmes and the government by striving to deploy of public research funding from is carrying out labour market analyses restructuring the first flow of funds to convert knowledge into innovations of the range of programmes and the development of from and as much earlier as possible from knowledge knowledge bases in professional higher education will take to learning to cash register performance agreements will be place in with the professional field new made with the research universities and universities of programmes on offer such as the ad programmes and the applied sciences about the goals to be achieved professional master degree will match the needs of the labour market with the reinforcement of practice oriented research via the centres of expertise the business community teachers and students are brought together sector plans will anticipate labour market shortages examples include the amendment of legislation and regulations physics and chemistry sector plan the tus sector plan and the engineering technology sector plan for professional legislation for the study completion delay measure and the higher education finally the government is conducting social lending system in the master phase has already been feasibility study into labour market indicators for the benefit taken up in addition two larger legislation tracks emanate of the new funding system employers are also making from this strategic agenda more active contribution to higher education on the one the first track is focused on measures to hand by better articulating their demand for higher education assure diploma quality the act is intended to enter into graduates and their educational needs to the educational force in september this means discussion in the institutions and on the other hand by creating practical house of representatives in the spring of training positions and scholarships for students and the second track is focused on the measures seconding subject teachers in this strategic agenda regarding study success study quality differentiation in the range of programmes on offer and funding the act is intended to enter into force in september support for the top sectors approach and in addition the regulatory measures concerning macro reinforcing valorisation efficiency will be amended this relates not only to the start of new programmes the existing range of programmes for the policy outlined in this strategic agenda for higher each sector will also be periodically analysed steps after the present government term of office to achieve the future perspectives for the road taken by this government must be continued after as said profiling improvement in study culture quality improvement differentiation of programmes on offer and adjusting the funding requires long term approach in the government will draw up an interim report on the changes of direction we have taken in the review committee will be asked for advice on the manner in which the process should be continued attention will in any case be paid to the extent to which the goals in the reports of the association of universities in the netherlands and netherlands association of universities of applied sciences have been achieved in and to the results of the performance agreements with regard to quality and profile experience will then also have been gained with the suitability of quality indicators and their effects at the same time the effects of the resources used for advancing profiling and development of focus areas will be reviewed based on this evaluation in we shall determine whether the share of quality and profile in the education budget will increase from to with the change of direction that this government has taken the foundation has been laid for different type of steering and funding of higher education and research good performances in the fields of quality and profiling can be rewarded if there is extra money available for knowledge in the future then we have mechanism in place to further expand quality and profiling in higher education and research thus we have set the quality improvement across the entire spectrum of higher education as advocated by the committee in motion we have laid the foundation for better international competitive position for dutch research universities and universities
