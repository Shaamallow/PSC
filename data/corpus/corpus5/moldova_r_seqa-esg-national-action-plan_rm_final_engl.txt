integrated higher education study programs master degree study programs during also started the process of updating the guidelines for the external evaluation of doctoral degree study programs subsequently the activity on this document was partially stopped considering the provisions of the higher education project financed by the world bank which will contribute decisively to the

also needs to be revised on the basis of the best practices of european quality assurance agencies and the own experience gained during the evaluation of study programs in carrying out the external evaluation activities involves expert evaluators that the agency selects based on its own methodology for selecting the expert evaluators the selection of the expert evaluators is made through an open competition announced by on its website the examination and acceptance of the file the evaluation and selection of the expert evaluators is done by the department of evaluation in higher education and the profile committee in higher education the selected candidates are included in the register of expert evaluators on general fields of study external evaluation panels must include expert evaluators

and of the profile committees conditions procedures for their selection and appointment structure and staff of the administrative apparatus methodology of calculation of fees as well as fees charged for evaluation procedures remuneration of members of the governing board profile committees administrative apparatus and expert evaluators are established by regulatory acts approved by the government in coordination with the ministry of education culture and research the strict regulation of the staff including the positions and functions conditioned by the statute of as subordinate structure of the caps the salaries for employees and practically makes impossible the interventions of adapting the staff to the current needs of the agency for example the position of lawyer is missing even if the accomplishment of the entity requires even two specialists in law on the other hand this situation regarding the strictly regulated remuneration of civil servants negatively influences the level of attractiveness of the positions put up for competition another challenge refers to the staff of the department of evaluation in higher education the activities updating of the normative and framework the organization of the process of external evaluation of study programs and higher education institutions elaboration of thematic studies as well as other activities in the field of competence are carried out within the department of evaluation in higher education by employees head of department main specialist senior specialist specialist the number of employees of the department according to the regulated staff number of the administrative apparatus of the agency is of maximum persons however even in the case of completing the staff number of the department with people this low number of employees and the amount of their workload is not sufficiently related to the number of study programs and higher education institutions subject to external evaluation thus in order to solve to some extent this deficiency it is necessary to review and adapt the normative regulatory framework in this regard qa activities and their methodologies quality assurance in higher education is achieved through set of actions to develop the institutional capacity to develop plan and implement study programs which forms and strengthens the trust of beneficiaries that the institution providing education meets and improves quality standards in accordance with its mission the fully functional national quality assurance system involves two successive stages the

out their professional activity in the field subject to evaluation but also foreign experts must be independent not represent the interests of the organization to which they belong or of other third parties confirm the absence of conflicts of interest and have the obligation to keep confidentiality of information challenge in the selection and involvement of expert evaluators however lies in the fact that the republic of moldova is small country where the entire academic community forms family and respectively everyone knows each other thus in order to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest of any kind the agency places great emphasis on involving experts for peer reviews and raising awareness of this fact the training of expert evaluators is mandatory part of the external quality evaluation process for the authorization of the provisional operation and accreditation of study programs and higher education institutions it aims to develop and ensure the necessary competencies of external experts to promote the objectivity and consistency of the agency decisions in the field of external quality assurance in higher education the training of the expert evaluators

stakeholder engagement the categories of stakeholders actively involved in quality assurance activities in higher education are higher education institutions teachers students and business representatives the council of the ministry of education culture and research thus in the composition of the governing board of the agency which is the collective management body that ensures the elaboration and implementation of the agency strategy there are representatives of teachers students and employers at the same time the external evaluation panels are constituted on principles of including the following categories of stakeholders representatives of the academic environment representatives of the students and representatives of the employers businesses in the following table we

encourages the activities of evaluators and evaluated institutions by awarding diplomas of recognition and the quality crystal distinction systematic involvement of evaluators in external evaluation missions expert training sessions dissemination on social media pages facebook agency website encouraging motivating recognizing their expertise in order to continuously improve the quality of education and the higher education system in order to identify potential evaluators in various fields of training and involve them in the agency external evaluation activities several information seminars and training sessions are organized which explain the evaluation procedure stages rights and responsibilities of expert evaluators etc in order to ensure the dissemination of good practices regarding the external evaluation process as well as to intensify the inter institutional collaboration aimed to identify and involve experts from as many higher education institutions as possible at the same time in the conditions of applying the external evaluation procedure of the quality of some study programs which are provided by only one higher education institution state university of medicine and pharmacy technical university of moldova agrarian state university of moldova state university of physical education and sports it was real challenge to identify potential evaluators considering the fact that the market of educational services in the republic of moldova is very limited also in the process of selecting the evaluators pays special attention to students and employers representatives whose involvement contributes to increasing the connection between the contents offered in the national higher education system and labor market requirements to the development of the practical nature of the study programs in this regard representatives of employers from several institutions were identified selected and trained such as state ministry of economy and infrastructure ministry of foreign affairs ministry of health labor and social protection research institutes ministry of education culture and research state and private enterprises etc analyzing the composition of the external evaluation panels from the perspective of the higher education institution where the evaluators work we can conclude that in the external evaluation process organized by were trained as experts teachers with scientific degrees and students from universities and employers representatives from over profile institutions in the country including international experts from the main objective of the department of evaluation in higher education in this segment of activity was to strengthen the database of expert evaluators diversify evaluators according to areas of training so that they can cover as many study programs motivation and promoting the involvement of students with an active role in the external evaluation process setting up ad hoc evaluation panels to avoid possible prior agreements or national action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the republic of moldova for the period litigation promoting professionalism objectivity and the spirit of in external quality evaluation activities another important aspect is the feedback provided to the experts the members of the evaluation panels are given feedback in relation to their activity how they behaved during the site visit but also what topics were not discussed institutions are required to provide feedback in the form of post evaluation questionnaire on the work of experts however the experts are not informed about the feedback that receives from institutions in the context of capitalizing on collaboration agreements with partner quality assurance agencies continuously updating the register of evaluators as well as in order to strengthen the composition of external evaluation panels involves both external evaluators of in the process of external evaluation of study programs as well as citizens of the republic of moldova abroad who work in higher education and or research institutions thematic analysis in order to align with the requirements set out in the standards and guidelines for quality assurance in the european higher education area esg the national agency for quality assurance in education and research has initiated the process of developing thematic studies in this sense following the external evaluations of the bachelor degree programs in the general field of study arts elaborated the thematic study the external evaluation of the quality of the bachelor degree study programs in the general field of study arts and humanities the study is an analysis of the field of training arts and humanities and contains series of recommendations for various categories of beneficiaries at the same time in order to disseminate the results of the external evaluation to the evaluated study programs plans the elaboration of thematic studies on general fields of study at the end of each evaluation cycle the publication of these studies on the agency website the presentation of study results within dissemination activities conferences seminars workshops round tables meetings national action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the republic of moldova for the period priority actions in developing the methodology for external evaluation the active and effective involvement of higher education institutions and other relevant stakeholders such as students potential employers ministries is an important way to increase their commitment to external quality assurance and quality assurance activities and to develop the level of trust between and other stakeholders their involvement is also very important from the perspective of raising awareness among all stakeholders about the expectations and perspectives that the agency must take into account and accept in balanced and reasonable manner however although all stakeholders need to be actively involved in the development of methodology regulations guidelines and other documents for the application of quality assurance procedures the agency has the highest expertise in making the right decisions based on the various opinions presented at the same time it should be borne in mind that updates and changes should normally be made at the end of cycle of activities external evaluation of bachelor and master degree study programs and that stakeholders should be involved in the continuous improvement of the methodology the accreditation standards in number implemented by comply with the recommendations of the standards and guidelines esg part standards and guidelines for internal quality assurance containing criteria performance indicators and evaluation standards that higher education institutions must perform in order to demonstrate the level of quality of the services provided at the same time follows the requirements of esg standards part standards and guidelines for external quality assurance thus higher education institutions conduct an internal evaluation and prepare the self evaluation report in accordance with the requirements set out in the guidelines for external evaluation applied by external evaluation panels are set up independently by the agency the experts in these panels are trained on the whole external evaluation procedure the expert evaluators analyze the self evaluation reports of the institutions visit the institutions subject to evaluation interview the institution management teaching staff students graduates employers analyze the relevant documentation complete the site visit record sheet prepare the external evaluation report formulating strengths recommendations and mandatory areas of improvement to the evaluated study program the external evaluation report is sent to the institution for comments which are subsequently discussed in the panel and the corresponding decision is made the next step of analyzing the external evaluation report and approving the decision is made within the profile committee and only then the board takes the decision which is sent to the educational institution but also to the ministry of education culture and research for the final approval and decision making the methodology for external evaluation modified in without the agency consent generates series of regarding the final results of the external evaluation in the current version the methodology describes two types of decisions compared to four options in the initial version of the methodology if all accreditation standards meet the requirements the agency governing board proposes to the study program or educational institution for period of years an national action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the republic of moldova for the period accreditation standard is considered to meet the requirements if more than of the performance indicators correspond to the mandatory minimum level set by the agency if three or more accreditation standards do not meet the requirements or at least one mandatory minimum evaluation standard is not met the agency governing board proposes not to the study program or educational institution an accreditation standard is considered non compliant if less than of the performance indicators meet the mandatory minimum level set by the agency the current situation with vacuum between and creates impediments because no decisions can be made if such situations are found the governing board uses as an emergency solution included in the post evaluation follow up procedure the possibility to postpone the accreditation decision and to offer the institution the possibility to improve the situation and demonstrate the improvement initially presenting an action plan with corrective measures and subsequently report on the implementation of this plan on the basis of which the final decision is taken although second visit to the institution is legally allowed this is not done due to the lack of financial resources and the small number of agency staff the emergency solution used by undermines the consistency and reliability of the entire external quality evaluation process thus the criteria for making final decisions need to be clarified the solution could be to return to the previous formula with four possible decision options or compromise option could be to supplement it with third conditional accreditation option in the case of accreditation decisions as result of the external evaluation post evaluation monitoring procedure follow up is not currently applied to all evaluated institutions study programs in the period until the next accreditation which means that the existing procedure is not consistent and complete in terms of achieving the full quality cycle but also compliance with esg requirements thus the concept the form of follow up may be different reports seminars conferences etc but it is also important that it includes the agency feedback in the external evaluation activities involves expert evaluators included in the register of expert evaluators of the agency whose basic activity consists in carrying out peer evaluation the evaluators who are part of the external evaluation panels always represent the academic environment students and employers business environment the experts are trained by and their training is mandatory as perspective actions we aim to test professional competencies and certify expert evaluators continuously completing the register of expert evaluators considering the fact that in the republic of moldova there are study programs belonging to quite specific fields of professional training medicine horticulture agronomy sports veterinary medicine architecture etc these being provided only by single higher education institution state university of medicine and pharmacy technical university of moldova state agrarian university of moldova etc it is real challenge to identify potential expert evaluators given that the market for educational services in our country is very small in this sense but also in other cases the involvement of international experts is solution and the regulatory framework allows this an impediment in achieving this goal is the fact that the entire external evaluation process is conducted in romanian experts must know the legal framework and national context of higher education and the involvement of international experts involves higher costs from institutions however the co opting practices of foreign experts require development and expansion the mission of the agency is established by the government with tasks and control that are not compatible with those of an independent quality assurance agency and oriented towards continuous quality assurance and improvement in education the independence of national action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the republic of moldova for the period the agency is greatly affected by the changes made in in the education code the methodology for external evaluation and in the regulation on the organization and operation of thus with regard to organizational independence the governing board is elected by committee of independent experts appointed by the agencies registered in at the request of the ministry of education culture and research the president and vice president are elected and appointed by the government and the ministry of education the agency does not define its structure and number of employees the agency recruits its staff members according to the rules of the public competition and they carry out their activity within the limits provided by the law on the civil service and the status of the civil servant the government defines the level of staff salaries hence the reluctance of specialists to work within the agency operational independence the selection recruitment of experts takes place without any influence from third parties the evaluation processes are carried out independently but in terms of defining its own procedures there is limitation of the agency independence even if the law says that develops in accordance with european standards in the field and makes public its own methodology for the evaluation and accreditation of institutions providing professional training and their study programs which it proposes for approval to the government modification in of the methodology for external evaluation without consulting the agency independence of formal outcomes although the governing board makes the decision of authorization non authorization for provisional operation accreditation non accreditation the final decision is still adopted by the ministry of education culture and research the elaboration and continuous development of the normative and framework in order to develop and consolidate positive orientation of the academic community regarding the process of external quality assurance in higher education is priority for in view of the above several actions need to be taken priority would be the changes of the existing regulatory framework in the field with the involvement
