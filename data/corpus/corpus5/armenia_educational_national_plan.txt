creation of new fields of studies theology fine arts social works political science et expansion of basic sciences law economy and introduction of other obligatory and selective courses and of education expansion of autonomy of higher educational institutions in the fields of management and funding development of the principles for state order admission entrance requirements approval of the education criteria for higher professional education by the government of roa regulation of the performances of non state higher educational institutions by implementation of the licensing and accreditation order of the government of roa which promotes competitiveness in the field of higher education there are more than local and international organizations that implement various programs in the field of education armenia educational national plan doc state program for educational development ii problems of education various problems have emerged in the field of education due to the social economic though situation of the country the continuous decline of population standards of living and soaring poverty have been directly reflected in the field of education and the mentioned factors jointly have had negative impact on the quality of education resulting in the decline of the overall educational level of population significant number of the problems and difficulties existing at all the educational levels are characteristic for the system however certain part of them are typical for that certain levels the problems characteristic for the system are the following disproportional funding and under funding of the educational system insufficient funding is one of the main reasons causing the crises in the field of education following its independence the economy of armenia suffered sharp decline the gdp level in decreased for compared to the level however due to the implementation of reforms by the government towards establishment of market economy the economic decline in the recent years has been suspended and moreover even some increase has been registered however the low level of gdp is still maintained therefore the state budget and adequately the share of the state funding allocation to the field of education is very little the field gets funding which is considerably less than the real needs are thus in the last years the funding for education totals to of the gdp this is almost half of the international criteria besides the shortage of budgetary allocations the share of education within the structure of the state budget is small enough too though it has tendency to grow in the last years the state funding for education constitutes the of the total budget which is significantly less than the international standards are the tough financial situation of the field gets even more difficult because some part of the funds to be allocated to education and projected in the law of roa on the budget are not being provided resulting in year to year debt and the payments are made with regular delays given the lack of resources their effective utilization becomes priority the existing budgetary and non budgetary resources are being allocated and utilized in non efficient manner uncoordinated and not in line with international standards in terms of the levels of education pre school main school secondary school mid and higher professional education as well as budget line items within the framework of certain educational institutions the parents contributions too are not coordinated and in some cases also have shadow character the current structure for armenia educational national plan doc state program for educational development state funding of the education still bears the influence of soviet norms though undergoes changes in line with the development of market relations the budget analysis reveals the prioritization of secondary education by the state in the structure of education funding the share of secondary education in has increased for compared to the level of which totaled to exceeding the average european standards however it should be mentioned that the budgetary allocations provided for the secondary education increase not because of the general increase of the share of education in the state budget but because of the ongoing cut offs in the other levels of education thus the state funding for preschool education has gradually decreased starting from and has been completely suspended since the imperfect legislation lack of by laws and incomplete implementation of laws when adopting the law of roa on education there were already number of some principle laws by laws and the civil code of roa providing for the implementation of state governance local self governing social economic financial and tax policies therefore certain articles of the law actually have been adjusted to the already existing legislation thus turning the law of roa on education into an incomplete law the inadequate implementation of laws and by laws imperfect implementation mechanisms or their non existence delayed adoption of certain laws as well as contradictions of the legislation hinder the complete implementation of the education policy actually the legislation of roa currently does not provide for the progressive development of the education as stated and guaranteed in the law of roa on education as the most important factor for strengthening the statehood article point the enforcement quality of laws and legislative acts as well as the lack of functional control mechanisms for protection of the rights of subjects involved in educational processes cause specific problems thus the expansion clarification and proper implementation of the legislation turns into an acute problem demanding an urgent solution the imperfect governance unclear delineation and coordination of functions insufficient horizontal links among the different levels of governance armenia educational national plan doc state program for educational development the lack of operative connections between the state regional and local self governing bodies is the result of the imperfect legislation in the field of education the educational institutions are under the supervision of different agencies and there are not by laws with clearly functions the lack of legislative acts for governance coordination causes serious difficulties for the education governing authorized entity in carrying out responsibilities the unsolicited adoption of normative acts by the executive entities causes contradictions in the system of governance in almost all the levels of the education governance there is lack of required skills the self governing mechanisms of the educational institutions are poorly developed too the lack of competitiveness among the educational institutions as well as the poor contesting conditions of certain institutions hinder achieving autonomy for provision of real development of the institutions the real basis for autonomy is not established yet because of the lack of control system too the involvement of the society in the education management and democratization of the education system are developing at slow pace the control mechanisms and reporting systems required as pre condition and tools for efficient management of education is not developed yet the problems of reliable data collection assessment and based on them efficient decision making come forward slow pace of integration into the international educational system and following the collapse of the soviet system the education structure of armenia has not yet gained new quality in terms of its structure contents and management and cannot be compared with the education systems of the developed countries the international integration of the education system of armenia is hindered by the lack of state unified education criteria for all the levels of education the lack of unified system of education levels and in terms of structure and duration of the education the slow pace of introduction of new educational and information technologies in the field of education those involved in the educational processes do not possess sufficient knowledge on the information technologies which is one of the first pre conditions for international integration and the demand of the st century threshold the intensification of the international integration of education is important from the national point of view as well provision of quality education meeting the international requirements will harmonize the knowledge of armenians dispersed all over the wold with various cultural backgrounds and their personal qualities therefore it is required armenia educational national plan doc state program for educational development to promote integration in two aspects international and national meanwhile by turning the first one into beneficial point for the second one decline in the access for education and enrollment one of the acute issues of the field of education is the unequal condition for getting education for the different social groups which creates discrepancy in the right of every citizen entitled to get education as stipulated by the constitution of roa and the possibilities for its realization the following several main factors cause the of education low standards of living of the majority of population and insolvency decreased state order for middle and higher professional education lack of required means and adequate conditions for involvement of children with need for special education in the educational processes demographic changes caused by the population movement and difficulties related to involvement of temporarily leaving the republic and then returning children in the educational processes given the problems of language barriers and physiological adjustments the listed factors result in the enrollment decline in almost all levels of education and decline of professional level the implementing partner of the state program for educational development should be the teacher whereas currently the field of education faces the problem of staffing with several variations steady tendency for employing elderly pedagogical staff the average age group of the in the secondary schooling is about of every teacher is pensioner the average age group of the professors lecturers involved in the field of higher education is and in certain specialties it comes to over gender inequality the problem has several variations in the secondary school the feminization is obvious of the teachers are women which does not provide for development of full fledged citizen and in the field of higher education on the contrary male specialists prevail outflow of qualified cadres and their replacement with non professionals because of the salary levels and low rating of the profession and poor social protection there is an on going steady outflow of qualified specialists from the sector for which the quality of the pedagogical and scientific pedagogical staff suffered and caused the armenia educational national plan doc state program for educational development brain drain in the field of secondary education of teachers do not have professional education in this aspect the situation is even worse in rural schools which does not guaranty the citizen residing in rural areas enjoyment of his her right to qualified education the teachers personnel of the republic are allocated if in the urban areas there is an accumulation of pedagogical staff than in rural schools there are vacancies for teachers when the number of actual teachers there exceeds the stated norms for incomplete provision of qualification improvement training and attestation processes if the qualification improvement and training activities have had formal character within the last decade few have been involved in them than the attestation has never been applied though some certain efforts have been made during the recent two years aimed at it however the problem needs complex solution the training of diaspora teachers comes forward as separate issue in this sphere the mapping of diaspora educational institutions is almost accomplished their specific needs are being identified and coordinated the priority among them is the provision with armenian subjects teachers towards which should be directed the efforts of teachers qualification improvement and growth of generation implementing the updated and clarified national ideology of for diaspora to that end the attainment of armenian pedagogical ideology is also urgent imperfect preparation system quality decline in specialists preparation is the consequence of an imperfect system it includes not modern curriculum and educational plans unsatisfactory professional levels of professors gap between the theory and practice new teaching methods are not being introduced the requirements imposed on the system of education are being ignored there is no conformity in the labor and education markets in the field of secondary schooling the low quality of teachers is of particular concern the existing system of pedagogical education does not provide for the full development of teacher professional skills and personal qualities in the field of higher and post graduate education the reduction of state order in ma and ph degree programs for times and negligence of basic innovative and prospective scientific directions and social sciences in the structure of state order do not provide for the education science connection and limitation of the preparation of professionals with higher education in the local scientific schools do not provide adequate level of scientific pedagogical personnel whereas as stated in the law of roa on education the progressive development of education can be achieved only by bringing together the educational and scientific activities with focus on fast transfer of innovative armenia educational national plan doc state program for educational development knowledge connected to the strengthening of democracy processes in the republic and of education the issue of preparation and re training of specialists in anthropological sciences international relations social work political sciences economy law etc becomes an acute one the change in the role of and its functions is problem of prospective development of education the phenomena typical to transition period poverty unemployment violence etc are reflected in the field of education by making necessary the expansion of professional preparation today he also needs the background in physiology sociology conflict resolution etc the quick growth and update of the vast knowledge typical for the informed society formed by the end of the century force to focus on teaching of basic sciences which can regularly be updated and adjusted and for the on turning from the main source of knowledge into architect summarizing and coordinating the knowledge of the students the solution of the mentioned problems requires complex adjustments in the fields of preparation of and scientific qualification improvement and training division in the educational and training upbringing processes the education system of independent armenia had to free itself from the imposed ideological chain by channeling the education contents out of class and out of school activities towards achievement of new objective formation of citizen bearing the national and international values however because of the lack of national ideological propaganda the development of new concept for upbringing citizen in compliance with the new political and social economic situations is still pending in the grades of values the place of education is left vacant the rating of upbringing has suffered the subjects forming an individual are not fixed in the curricula the low level of psychological pedagogical background of the teachers significantly weakened the upbringing function of the lessons the school parent society relation is broken and sects have penetrated into schools the severe insufficiency of funding or its absolute lack for out of class and out of school activities that are the continuation of educational processes dissolution of number of entities providing additional education changing their profiles and providing mainly paid services have resulted in sharp decline of this type of education accessibility and reduction of the services provided as consequence the completeness of the upbringing system the unification of education and upbringing is destroyed the students armenia educational national plan doc state program for educational development are deprived of the right of being involved in something within their interests the number of street children and children braking the laws have increased thus in the new political and socioeconomic situation the re establishment and development of educational institutions and as whole the upbringing function of the education system and integration of general and additional education becomes an acute problem demanding urgent solution insufficient material technical and training basis in the past ten years the building maintenance of the education system has been destroyed particularly the secondary schooling has suffered following the earthquake and warring activities some schools have suffered by being completely destroyed or down in the last years many of them have been rehabilitated through the funds of state budget and international organizations however in the disaster zone there still are number of schools operating in and construction of typical buildings for them is very urgent and still many educational institutions all over the republic do not have satisfactory buildings almost schools mainly in rural areas needs capital or partial renovation particularly roofing and bathrooms for several years the issue of regular heating of the educational institutions is not being solved if some of the institutions have somehow addressed the issue than in schools the classrooms are still heated by stoves oil heaters and electric devices buildings of mid level professional institutions and some buildings of higher educational institutions are not heated at all which causes their destruction and breaks the rhythm of the educational processes because of lack of funding the healthcare and sanitary hygienic requirements of the educational processes are not being met as well as the norms of individual protection and safety at all the educational levels the institutions have not been provided with furniture laboratory equipment training didactic materials and test materials the modern technical devices equipment for practical work information and computer equipment and communication means for education is strictly limited the training activities the variety of publications of professional literature and their volume have decreased and as to the imported professional literature and publications mainly they are to the vulnerable groups involved in the field of education armenia educational national plan doc state program for educational development if the problem of providing the secondary schools with educational literature is mainly resolved than the efforts in formation of literature in the field of professional education their translation and localization is still unsatisfactory the library funds of the institutions are outdated and worn out do not meet the requirements of modern libraries in terms of space refurbishment and technical services provided electronic libraries inefficient utilization of the system the tough situation of the educational institutions is reasoned not only by the lack of financial resources but also by their inefficient utilization even if the economy development and state revenue collection proceed in the predicted way still the improved budgetary resources will not be enough for covering the minimal needs of education if radical rationalization is not carried out in the field the following main factors the current situation of the system state that fact student relationship significant numbers of support and administrative staff under filled grades and groups under staffed pedagogical personnel disproportional allocation of educational institutions all over the republic and particularly the number of closely located schools in densely populated areas significant number of under loaded institutions strict centralization particularly in the capital of armenia of narrowly specialized special boarding schools and institutions providing various educational programs mid and higher professional institutions there are additional problems in the field of mid and higher professional education duplication of the offered degree programs not in compliance with the institution profile disproportional allocation of the institutions and offered courses by their location not in compliance with social economic and development perspectives of the certain areas therefore there is need for rationalization not only in the entire field of education re allocation of institutions and fields of studies but within each institution as well pupil teacher ratio growth of training group etc armenia educational national plan doc state program for educational development mismatch of the education structure and contents to the requirements of market relations the education structure now undergoes stage of re arrangement and re formation there are structural problems not only in the field of secondary schooling but also in the field of professional education the necessity of overloaded curricula age group of the enrolled students and employment problems dictate the need of shifting over from the year to year secondary schooling the basic general education does not provide for the further education of the graduates and their social adjustment therefore the need for changes in the secondary school criteria curricula of fields of studies textbooks and re distribution of training materials according to the year schooling requirements becomes necessity the policy implemented in the filed of pre professional education needs clarification particularly in demand list of professions and funding in the field of higher education one year and two grade systems are operational which makes the labor market survey necessary in terms of preparation of specialists with ba ma and ph degrees the development of unified gradation system of professional education qualifications starting from pre professional and including the post graduate levels is global issue the level of involvement of enterprises in education provision and development is at an extremely low level the slow pace of education contents update does not provide for spiritual economic and social progress of society heading to democratization for formation of citizen and establishment of open society and lawful statehood lack of courses on market relations civil education principles of economy human rights life skills ecological education etc or their suspended introduction into the education providing for the multi sided development of an individual and practical qualities gained by education impair the and of education each of the presented problems has its contribution in the final product of
