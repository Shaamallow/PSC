homeland nature culture technology health and other topics it focuses on the past as well as the present and leads towards the acquisition of skills for practical life through its broadly conceived synthesized integrated content this educational area participates in forming mandatory basic education at stage education in the area of humans and their world develops the knowledge skills and initial experience which pupils have acquired in their families and during pre school education pupils learn to observe and name things and phenomena their and contexts and thus acquire their first coherent picture of the world they learn about themselves and their immediate surroundings and gradually become familiar with physically and chronologically more removed persons and phenomena and more complex events they learn to understand people and their and to notice observe and contemplate substantial factual and aesthetic features of human works and natural phenomena based on their understanding of themselves their needs and the world around them the pupils learn to perceive principal social relations to understand the current way of life with its strengths and weaknesses and to see the present as the result of the past and starting point for the future when acquiring the knowledge and skills contained in the educational area of humans and their world pupils learn to express their thoughts observations and impressions and to respond to the ideas opinions and suggestions of others successful education in this area is conditioned upon pupils own experience of specific or model situations when acquiring the necessary skills and approaches the teacher personal example contributes significantly to making this possible linking this educational area with real life situations and with pupils practical experience greatly helps pupils handle new situations and new roles and helps them find their position among peers and strengthen their work and social habits in this way the educational area provides the foundations for more specialised instruction in the educational areas of humans and society and humans and nature and the educational field of health education the educational content of the educational area humans and their world is divided into five thematic areas by combining these thematic areas within the sep it is possible to create various alternative subjects and educational contents in the thematic area the place where we live pupils based on themselves with their immediate surroundings learn about relationships and contexts and understand the organisation of life in the family at school in the community and in society they learn to participate actively in daily life with their own ideas to pursue new and interesting things and to move safely around this world emphasis is placed on traffic education practical knowledge of local and regional reality and on developing pupils personal experience diverse activities and tasks should naturally encourage pupils to form positive relationship with the place where they live gradually develop their national consciousness and form positive relationship to our country in the thematic area people around us pupils gradually acquire and reinforce the basics of proper manners and behaviour towards other people they gradually realize the importance and essence of tolerance assistance mutual respect and solidarity among people including gender equality they learn how people come together enjoy themselves and create culture they learn about basic rights and responsibilities but also about problems related to the coexistence of people entire it is traditionally possible to create one subject in grades to select subject matter from various thematic areas to match the expected outputs for period and two subjects in grades to use thematic areas and as foundation for national geography and history and areas and for science it is also possible to create only one subject in grades and or one subject throughout grades to it is not always necessary to stick strictly to the thematic areas the subject matter can be structured combined or distributed in various ways so as to meet the expected outcomes societies or even the world global problems the entire thematic area thus focuses on providing the initial knowledge and skills required by future citizens of democratic country the thematic area people and time facilitates an understanding of events and time pupils learn how and why time is measured and how events proceed in time and create the history of things and events they learn how life and things develop and what changes they are subjected to over time this thematic area begins with the most familiar events in the family community and region and proceeds towards the most important moments in the history of our country the essence of the thematic area is to encourage pupils to take an interest in history and the cultural wealth of the region and the entire country it is therefore important that pupils can independently search for obtain and explore information from available sources particularly from members of their family and people around them so that they can jointly visit historical sights regional and specialised museums public libraries etc in the thematic area diversity of nature pupils learn about the earth as planet in the solar system where life was created and has been evolving they get acquainted with the extensive diversity and variability of animate and inanimate nature in our country they are guided to realize that the earth and life on it constitute one integral entity where all major actions exist in harmony and balance which people can easily disturb and restore only with difficulties based on practical exploration of the countryside and other information pupils learn to seek out evidence of changes in nature and to identify ways in which they at their age can contribute to environmental protection and sustainable development in the thematic area people and their health pupils focus on exploring themselves as living human beings with specific biological and physiological functions and needs they learn how human beings develop and change from birth to adulthood and what is good and what is bad for them in terms of daily regime hygiene nutrition interpersonal relationships etc they acquire basic knowledge of health and diseases health prevention and first aid and safe conduct in various life situations including emergency situations threatening the health of individuals and groups of people pupils gradually realize the extent to which each person is responsible for his her health and safety as well as the health of other people they learn to recognise that health is the most valuable aspect of their lives they acquire the necessary knowledge and skills by observing visual aids and specific situations and through role playing and model situations aims of the

the educational area at the level of basic education the educational area humans and society provides pupils with the knowledge and skills necessary for their active engagement in the life of democratic society the aim of instruction is for pupils to learn the historical social and cultural aspects of human life in all its diversity and mutual contexts pupils are introduced to the development of society and to important social phenomena and processes found in daily life which influence the formation of the social climate the focus is on the formation of positive civic attitudes the development of conscious sense of belonging to european civilisation and culture and the adoption of the values on which contemporary democratic europe is founded an important part of education in this educational area is the prevention of racist xenophobic and extremist attitudes learning tolerance and respect for human rights gender equality respect for the natural and cultural environment and the preservation of artistic and cultural values in the educational area of humans and society pupils acquire important skills and attitudes for applying their knowledge of society and interpersonal relationships in civil life pupils learn to identify and describe social issues from the past and present to gather and process information necessary for solving these problems finding solutions and drawing conclusions and to reflect on solutions and apply them in real life situations the educational area of humans and society is divided into the educational fields of history and civil education their educational content links directly with the educational area of humans and their world this educational area also overlaps with other educational areas and with school life in general and has direct ties to the social sciences section of the educational field of geography which in the interest of maintaining the field integrity has been placed entirely within the educational area of humans and nature the educational field of history offers basic information on past human events its main objective is to cultivate the individual historical consciousness and to maintain the continuity of historical memory primarily in passing on historical experience especially important is the learning of events deeds and phenomena which have fundamentally influenced the development of society and have imprinted themselves on our society emphasis is placed primarily on the history of the th and th centuries where we may find the roots of most contemporary social phenomena significant attention is paid to the basic values of european civilisation also important is the development of sense of time space and empathy which will enable pupils to better understand historical phenomena and events pupils are guided towards understanding that history is not closed part of the past or jumble of facts and definite conclusions but also involves asking questions through which the present looks into the past to find its contemporary character and possible future general historical issues are brought to life through regional and local history the educational field of civil education is focused on helping pupils themselves in social reality and to successfully participate in various social relations and relationships it opens the pupils path towards realistic self awareness acknowledging the personality of others and understanding their behaviour and that of others within the context of various life situations it introduces pupils to relationships within the family society economic life political bodies and institutions and possible forms of individual engagement in civil life pupils learn to respect and apply moral principles and rules of social coexistence and to take responsibility for their opinions behaviour and the results of their behaviour they develop their citizenship and legal consciousness reinforce their sense of personal and social responsibility and are motivated to actively participate in the life of the democratic society aims of the educational area instruction in this educational area focuses on the formation and development of key competencies by guiding pupils towards developing an interest in the present day and past of their nation and other cultures forming and reinforcing their conscious sense of belonging to european culture uncovering the roots of societal phenomena events and changes thinking about contexts and mutual in history and the present day finding parallels between past and present events and comparing them with similar and different phenomena and processes in europe and the world forming positive value system based on historical experience differentiating myth from reality identifying examples of and reasons for the subjective selection and assessment of facts and to objectively assess past and present social phenomena creating the ability to use diverse verbal and non verbal social and social science texts as sources of information developing an orientation in the multifaceted nature of historical socio cultural ethical political legal and economic facts

topics associated with the study of nature it provided pupils with the tools and methods for deeper understanding of natural phenomena and natural laws it also gives them the necessary foundation for better understanding and use of contemporary technology and helps them better orient themselves in everyday life in this educational area pupils receive an opportunity to get to know nature as system whose constituent parts are interconnected and and mutually influence one another based on this knowledge pupils realize the importance of maintaining the natural balance of existing living systems including humans the educational area also significantly promotes the creation of open thinking open to alternative viewpoints critical thinking and logical consideration through their activities and the research character of instruction the educational fields of the educational area of humans and nature physics chemistry nature and geography allow pupils to more deeply understand the laws of natural processes and thus to become aware of the usefulness of being familiar with the natural sciences and applying this knowledge in everyday life especially important is the fact that while studying nature through the help of specific learning methods pupils also learn important skills these include the ability to systematically objectively and reliably observe experiment and measure to make and test hypotheses regarding the essence of observed natural phenomena to analyse the results of their and on this basis to draw conclusions pupils thus learn to study the causes of natural processes and their or to ask questions how why what will happen if and to seek to answer them to explain observed phenomena to seek out and solve cognitive or practical problems and to use their knowledge of the laws of natural processes in order to predict or influence them in the aforementioned educational fields pupils gradually themselves with the complexity and diversity of the real

more than merely rational knowledge of the world and reflects an irreplaceable part of human existence arts and culture culture is not only the processes and results of mental activity which allow us to understand the continuity of changing historical experience including the individual socialization and his involvement into the life of the community but it is also an indivisible part of everyday life behaviour clothing travel work art is the specific process of understanding communicating and depicting the internal and external world and mutual which cannot be formulated or conveyed in any way other than through artistic means education in this area enables pupils to identify with the world artistically to develop an aesthetic identity during this process pupils develop their own feelings creativity and views of works of art and thus of themselves and their surrounding this process includes the search for and discovery of relationships between different types of art on the basis of common themes the ability to empathize with the cultural needs and values of others and to approach these topics with conscious personal involvement creative activities help to develop the ability to express oneself non verbally through tone and sound line points form colour gesture facial expressions and the like at the level of basic education arts and culture is represented by the educational fields of music and fine art the educational area may be expanded to include the additional field of drama education which can be implemented in the school education programme through independent subjects projects courses etc see chapter at stage of basic education pupils use activities to familiarize themselves with musical and artistic means of expression and the language of music and art as well as with theatre and literature they learn to work creatively and to use these forms of art as tools for self expression they learn the rules of creative work are introduced to selected works of art and based on their experiences learn to understand them and to recognize and identify their message at stage of basic education pupils are introduced to broader view of culture and art learning historical and cultural contexts which have influenced art and culture works of literature and drama theatre film represent another source of inspiration for artistic activities as do multimedia works and systems through projects the pupils discover relationships between individual types of art and make use of diverse range of expressive means while searching for individual solutions to commonly selected themes this provides common platform for gaining skills and knowledge beyond the framework of individual fields thus contributing to the creation of more personal and original self expression and deeper understanding of works of art through vocal and instrumental exercise movement and listening activities music guides pupils towards an understanding of the musical arts the active perception of music and song and their use as an original form of communication during basic education these musical activities production listening and reflection form the content of musical education as mutually interconnected and supplementary activities musical activities comprehensively develop the pupils overall personality and their musical talent in particular which is subsequently expressed through individual musical skills aural recognition rhythm singing intonation movement musical creativity and listening these activities allow pupils to apply their vocal potential in solo group and choral singing they can apply their instrumental skills in an orchestra and by accompanying vocals and can show their movement skills through dance and by accompanying music they are given the opportunity to interpret music on the basis of their own personal goals and interests vocal exercise includes voice work during which pupils cultivate singing and speaking while learning and reinforcing proper singing habits instrumental exercise includes playing musical instruments and using them during musical productions movement includes the representation of music and responding to it through movement dance and gesture listening exercise includes active perception of music during which pupils recognize musical genres styles and periods and learn to analyse and interpret music fine art involves work with visual images and symbols these are an irreplaceable tool for understanding and experiencing human existence creative work with these symbols and images based primarily on comparison of the pupils current and past experiences enables pupils to express their personal feelings and experiences though creativity perception and interpretation fine art education approaches visual artistic expression both individually created works as well as those of others not only as mere reflection of reality but also as tool which in shaping the reception of reality and its involvement in the process of communication at the level of basic education fine arts education is founded on creative activities creating perceiving and interpreting art these activities allow pupils to develop and apply their own perceptions feelings ideas experiences imagination fantasy intuition and which they can realize through visual means not just traditional and verified means but also newly emerging approaches in contemporary art and image media through creative activities developing the senses applying subjective viewpoint and verifying the communicative

towards life and acting in accord with these attitudes at the level of basic education these objectives must be founded on effective motivation and on activities and situations which will increase pupils interest in this topic implementation of this educational area should emphasize practical skills and their application in model situations and in daily school life it is thus extremely important that life at the school be in accord with the things pupils are learning in relation to health and their health related needs at the outset instruction must be strongly influenced by the teacher positive personal example and multifaceted support and an overall positive atmosphere at the school later the emphasis shifts on pupils greater independence and responsibility for their behaviour in decision making and health related activities education presented with these principles in mind forms the basis for forming the pupils active approach to promoting and protecting their health the educational area of humans and health is defined and implemented in an age appropriate manner through the educational fields of health education and physical education which also includes physical health education the educational content of humans and health is interwoven with the life of the school and with other educational areas which add to or make use of apply this area the

social well being physical education starts with spontaneous physical activity and moves on to guided and elective activities aimed at giving pupils the ability to independently judge their level of physical fitness and to include physical activity into their daily routine in order to satisfy their personal needs for and interests in physical activity to promote the optimum development of fitness and performance to recuperate strength and compensate for various forms of stress and to promote health and health protection one precondition for developing good exercise habits is that at the level of basic education pupils experience physical activities and communication during exercise properly learned skills reinforce the quality of the experience physical education is characterized by the recognition and development of talents and subsequently different activities for pupils and different evaluations of their performance it is particularly important to discern pupils physical weaknesses and to correct these through joint and individual forms of physical education both through mandatory physical education as well as if necessary through physical health education for this reason an inseparable part of physical education are corrective and special balancing exercises applied during physical education for all pupils as needed or assigned to pupils with physical weakness in place of activities which are of their weakness at the same time schools are recommended to offset the physical deficits of pupils in health category iii in special cases category ii and to provide corrective exercises by assigning mandatory or elective subject whose activities are taken from the thematic area of physical health education as satisfactory replacement for mandatory physical education or for expanding the range of physical exercises this range of exercises takes into account the state of modern society which in many ways has made our life easier but paradoxically has led to numerous health impairments at young age which must be rectified and corrected lack of intensive and proper physical activity long periods of time spent in sedentary positions excessive food intake and poor nutrition poor air quality frequent stressful situations negative social relations etc basic education thus responds to the findings of doctors that health impairments are on the rise in the entire population and that children with health impairments require greater amount of spontaneous and targeted physical activities than healthy children participation in physical health education

legal regulations allow an assistant teacher in the classroom or study group of decree no of act no if the pupil attends school for ten years stage is divided into period grades and period grades teaching socially disadvantaged pupils this group includes pupils from social or linguistic backgrounds which are different from that in which the majority population is growing up these pupils either belong to local minority or are the children of immigrants primarily refugees and asylum seekers in czech schools the number of such pupils is on the rise some such pupils are able to integrate into regular schools without serious problems while others may encounter various difficulties of linguistic nature or because they are deeply influenced by their families and cultural patterns which are reflected in behaviour actions and different values lifestyles concepts of relationship to education etc pupils from families with low socio cultural and economic standing are more frequently at risk of socio pathological influences for these reasons it is necessary to devote specific attention to these pupils to the extent they require from the very beginning of their schooling in most cases the main problem in teaching pupils from different cultural background is their lack of familiarity with the language of instruction this is symptomatic for the most minorities and ethnic groups for whom instruction does not take place in their mother tongue it is thus not only necessary to make sure that they learn the czech language but also that they become familiar with czech society and its cultural habits and traditions on the other hand it is necessary to ensure in accordance with the education act and under the conditions established therein that these pupils receive instruction in the language of the relevant national minority and are given the opportunity to receive information during their school career from which they may select elements in order to build their own identity this requires complementing the educational content to include specific materials on their nationality history culture and traditions the school long term objective must be the integration of pupils from different cultural and socially disadvantaged backgrounds the protection of their minority culture and the promotion of their success within the majority society it is thus vital that when preparing the sep schools be aware of the nationality ethnicity or value system of all their pupils and to respond as as possible to their cultural differences or to prepare an individual education plan for these pupils which meets their needs to the maximum possible extent conditions for teaching socially disadvantaged pupils the most important factor in successfully teaching pupils from culturally different and frequently also socially disadvantaged backgrounds is the teacher who should be familiar with his pupils and their family background be able to select an appropriate approach and to create welcoming social atmosphere in the school and classroom the school must make use of instructional methods which are suitable for the pupils diverse learning styles and different ways of organizing instruction and to plan instruction on the basis of the interests experiences and needs of pupils from various cultural ethnic and social backgrounds the successful education of socially disadvantaged pupils requires the following individual or group attention preparatory classes the aid of an assistant teacher smaller number of pupils per classroom corresponding methods and forms of work specific textbooks and materials regular communication and feedback cooperation with psychologist special education teacher child behavioural psychologist social worker or other specialists of

institutional and protective education of children requiring medical treatment as result of neurological damage and mental illness see to of decree no regulating the details of institutional and protective education at educational facilities the director of the school or educational facility may adjust the school education programme or the organization of education as established in the fep be according to the facility specific conditions and the pupils educational needs and abilities teaching exceptionally gifted pupils the education of exceptionally gifted pupils is an important part of basic education because exceptionally gifted pupils have specific educational needs which need to be addressed and require the creation of suitable conditions gifted is most commonly defined as possessing collection of abilities which enable the individual to attain higher level of achievement than the average population the number of exceptionally gifted pupils is estimated at to exceptionally gifted pupils may be gifted in one or several different areas basic education plays fundamental role in identifying and developing exceptionally gifted pupils this is primarily due to the fact that all pupils pass through this stage of education and it is long enough for systematically observing pupils in order to identify those who are gifted to provide appropriate motivation to develop their gifts and to provide them with opportunities for applying their gifts in specific activities these pupils require specific attention and support from the school and family particularly stimulation and the creation of suitable pre conditions for developing their talent identifying gifted pupils identifying exceptionally gifted pupils is long term process involving pedagogical psychological pedagogical psychological and lay techniques the main approach involves the observation of pupils during their school based work an analysis of pupils work outcomes and portfolios an assessment of tests and assignments and interviews with pupils and parents for pupils up to age it is especially difficult to determine whether they are exceptionally gifted or whether we are seeing uneven faster development which will gradually level out to the standard for their age while remaining in the upper average when looking for exceptionally gifted pupils it is important to pay attention to pupils with developmental disorders affecting their learning or behaviour physically disabled pupils and pupils from different cultural backgrounds or from disadvantaged social backgrounds with the approval of the pupil parents or legal guardians teachers may be aided in identifying gifted pupils and properly nurturing their gifts by psychologists from network of pedagogical psychological counselling centres specific characteristics of exceptionally gifted pupils the pupil knowledge exceeds the required level problematic attitude towards the rules of schoolwork tend to create their own rules tendency towards perfectionism and corresponding approach sometimes contentious to communication with the teacher personal working pace create their own approaches to solving assignments which allow for creativity little willingness to work together within the group quickly learn teaching approaches enjoy solving difficult assignments in particular in connection with high level of ability in the subject physically gifted pupils tend to overestimate their abilities good concentration and memory tend to seek out and find creative approaches insight into their own learning increased level of motivation for deeper approach to the basic subject matter especially in subjects of instructions in which the pupil is gifted although the question of gift or talent has been studied for more than hundred years there still exists no uniform of gifted or exceptionally gifted the estimated number of gifted pupils varies from author to author need to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and skills in the school environment formation of relationship networks among exceptionally gifted pupils among exceptionally gifted pupils the formation of relationship networks is influenced by their personality in particular their strong inclination towards introversion certain characteristics of these pupils personalities may also make it more difficult for them to form conflict free relationships with their peers teachers or themselves in particular their inclination towards perfectionism their heightened level of criticism towards themselves and the surrounding world and their specific sense of humour may influence the formation of relationships with their peers classmates for pupils who have not been provided with the tools for learning how to deal with their specific abilities their exceptional gifts may paradoxically cause them to form negative self image and to reject their special abilities at other times it may occur that an and environment causes such pupils to close themselves off into an inner world of their abilities and to refuse to communicate with the surrounding peer environment since many gifted pupils are introverts with poor social skills who prefer limited communication with their surroundings or are more inclined to communicating with older people this is quite common situation another important factor is the level to which the pupils gifts correspond to the abilities and opportunities in their surroundings their family classroom teachers and peers when the pupils start going to school it is important for them to become members of an age based community even if they usually find it easier to communicate with adults or older schoolmates gifted pupils frequently are afraid that they will not be able to integrate into their age based community as result they tend to deny their own abilities when trying to integrate into their natural peer age group with increased age these pupils display an increased social awareness and are well aware of their virtues and as well as their standing within their peer group where their exceptional gifts may even become reason for their peers admiration the formation of positive climate for exceptionally gifted pupils requires sufficient amount of sensitivity to the pupils specific needs on the part of those around them possible adjustments to the form of instruction provided to exceptionally gifted pupils the form of instruction used with exceptionally gifted pupils should consistently observe the principles of and internal differentiation examples of pedagogical organizational adjustments individual education plans complementing expanding and deepening the educational content assigning specific assignments including pupils into independent and more extensive work and projects internal differentiation of pupils in certain subjects temporary creation of groups for selected subjects with an open choice on the part of pupils for certain subjects participation
