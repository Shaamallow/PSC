document adopted by the croatian government on june the plan is based on a comprehensive systemic educational framework and was discussed by numerous social experts scientists and other partners over the past few years a particular strength of the document is its transparency regarding the needed improvements during the period of its implementation the aim of the development plan is to direct

croatia the development plan will be implemented within the existing funding structure of the government of the republic of croatia supported by a loan from the world bank eu pre accession funds for candidate countries and other sources therefore it is of paramount importance for the preparedness of the state to increase funding for education in order to get closer to european standards the government s proposed measures to improve education and training especially with regard to improving the educational infrastructure and adjusting secondary education so that it responds to the needs of young people will require more efficient allocation and the rational use of financial resources the implementation of the development plan is based on the annual development plan godi nji plan

studies development of education for teachers and instructors financing higher education adult education and training annex vii introduction taking into account the process of globalization and the stabilization process croatia is undergoing economic restructuring and the pressures of competition demographic factors as well as the need for modernization and the development of a knowledge based society and economy the need arises for effective changes in planning the development of the education system to ensure continuity new educational policies rely on preserving the fundamental values of the croatian society and previous educational documents and successful practices while also utilizing new guidelines and activities in order to develop the croatian educational system in line with the state of the art standards of europe and the rest of the world the provision of educational services is still to a large extent in the jurisdiction of state and local authorities however as a result of democratic changes private education institutions training institutions as well as the civil sector have become parts of the educational process the level of education in croatia is below the international average in many respects specifically according to the census percent of the population has not completed any form of schooling percent has not completed primary schooling percent of the population has only primary schooling and percent of the total population holds some form of secondary school education meanwhile percent of the population has completed two year college programs percent of the population holds bachelor master ph d degrees while the level of education for percent of the population is unknown it is important to note that this data refer to all people older than central bureau of statistics population census http www dzs hr hrv popis popis htm chart the percentage of the population over the age of according to the level of education completed data on participation levels in the educational system range from an almost full inclusion rate of children in primary education to according to european standards a below average participation rate in the tertiary education system according to official data participation in primary education is at percent approximately percent of primary school graduates enroll in secondary education and approximately percent of secondary school students complete their studies on time during the academic year a total of students or percent of youth aged to enrolled in tertiary education according to official statistics only percent of the students completed their university studies and only percent of the students graduated within the expected time a part of the legacy of the yugoslav educational system is the multiple shift arrangement in schools according to data of the ministry of science education and sports for the school year percent of elementary schools have double shifts while percent have triple shifts according to the same data the proportion of high schools that have double shifts is percent according to estimates by the ministry of science education and sports percent of primary school pupils and percent of secondary school pupils attend multiple shift schools this is obviously an obstacle to developing schools as whole day learning centers and it also makes teachers professional development in schools more difficult see table p also regional differences in the level of education of the population are most visible in the number of illiterate people in a certain region in comparison to the total illiteracy rate in croatia specifically counties such as po ega zadar and lika that are at a below average level of development have an illiteracy rate higher than percent however the total number of illiterate people is not much greater than in other countries a much greater problem is the large number of adults who did not finish or did not even start primary school as well as a considerable number of people who have only completed a secondary school education the high and long term level of unemployment of those who have completed secondary education demands the re examination of secondary education and its adjustment to the needs of the market in terms of the number of adults participating in primary school education no systematically gathered data exist but there are some on adult secondary education for example during the school year adults attended some type of verified secondary school program of which around percent of them are younger than approximately participants earned certificates upon completion of training programs and additional training the quality of education is in principle guaranteed by a high standard of teacher training it is therefore particularly important to pay attention to teachers education and continuing professional development table the structure of teacher training levels in croatia the level of education of teachers does not always correspond to the actual knowledge skills and competencies of teachers this discrepancy can be to poor programs and uneven implementation of undergraduate studies as well as inadequate and professional training the unemployment experienced by young people makes it difficult for them to take an active role in society compulsory education lasts eight years which means that students leave the educational system at the age of about their prospects of finding work are minimal considering the state of the economy and the unemployment level therefore special attention should be given to transforming vocational schools which should offer varied educational and training possibilities so that they are in accordance with the needs of employers and the real labor market data on adult education cdo zagreb education staff data base ministry of science education and sports the need to increase investment in education is clear in light of the high standards of other well established education systems with which we are seeking to align croatian education financing and distributing funds for educational priorities will be worked out following an analysis and monitoring of educational system needs at all levels when speaking of financing education in croatia the question arises of how to distribute financial resources to the various sub systems in education pre school primary secondary and tertiary education in addition the process of educational funding must take into account various changes in the country s demography as well as the fact that the size of the school age population is declining this has important implications for human capital and budgetary allocations for education demographic changes are not uniform across all regions of the country so the financing of education must take these regional variations into account changes in the environment the impact of social and economic changes on education the role of the education system is to create and develop intellectual professionally competent and humanistic oriented human capital that will benefit the country and the common good education has a crucial role in equipping all children young people and adults with equal opportunities when entering society and the labor market regardless of their social background the educational system now faces the challenge of promoting and maintaining national cultural and humanistic values which develop a sense of community acceptance and tolerance of differences solidarity responsibility for sustainable development as well as active citizenship and the development of democratic society as a whole a precondition for the active involvement of people in the economy and a society based on knowledge is the acquisition of a basic level of linguistic scientific mathematical technological and social education excessive differentiation in education and changing the economic and social environment could lead to fewer possibilities for continuing education and the exclusion of individuals and groups from the education system one of the greatest risks of the croatian educational system is precisely the question of adjusting to rapidly changing social needs accession to the european union creates new challenges for the croatian educational system such as attaining greater levels of quality flexibility mobility and responsiveness to changes in croatian society and the european community the european union policy of labor force mobility may result in young people leaving the country especially those with higher education brain drain in order to avoid these risks concerted action by the entire social and political community is necessary one of the prerequisites of active involvement in an information based society is equipping people with the skills to use information and communication technology ict in everyday life all education systems must face the challenges of an information based society in which the use of information and communication technologies opens a wide range of possibilities for sustainable learning opportunities considering the fact that ict has had a significant influence on the work environments and everyday life of people and has become an indispensable skill middle term and long term education strategies must contain measures for expanding the use of ict contributing to the democratization of the learning process and advancing the concept of flexible and individualized education for all demographic trends the population of croatia is predicted to decline by percent between and going from people in to in thus croatia s demographic structure will change radically primarily through predicted declines in the younger age groups by it is envisioned that the age group will decrease by about percent this trend will continue after table projected number of school age children and youth the demand for well educated citizens will increase with the emergence of the knowledge based economy at the same time some young people enroll at but never complete secondary or higher education while others do not continue with their education after leaving secondary school this problem demands specific measures within the education sector for pupils nearing the end of their secondary education such measures should keep them in the system and increase their employment opportunities the four principal ways in which the education system can respond to this problem are to increase the number of young people who complete secondary education to develop a system of professional information and counseling services available to these groups as part of a lifelong professional orientation program to promote the participation of adults with only primary education in adult education programs to invest in improving the quality of learning at all educational levels the shortage of workers will have a negative influence on economic growth the expected difficulties stemming from limited access to the labor market due to demographic developments point to the need for the improved efficacy and performance of the education system as well as the need to allow young people to obtain the necessary knowledge and skills in order to find employment after leaving primary and secondary education this assumes the increased involvement in education programs and training by adults world bank changes in the labor market the need for knowledge will increase it is estimated that the fastest growth in labor demand will take place in the intellectual services arena especially through the burgeoning information and communication technology sector ict the most dramatic drop in labor demand is expected in the lower level education workforce many jobs will require proficiency in modern technology the structure of occupations will increasingly rely on the need for lifelong learning the basic common competencies of obligatory and professional training will be developed according to european standards for the obligatory education system as well as professional training several common goals are emphasized acquiring language and communication skills improving information technology and communications literacy understanding mathematics natural sciences foreign languages social studies and entrepreneurship learning how to learn and general culture in case of rapid social and economic change and therefore changes in the labor market it is necessary to align and link pre school primary secondary and higher education as well as adult education and training the younger generations need to be prepared to work in challenging conditions so it is important to assess together with social and economic partners the required profiles of the emerging labor force regional development in the long term better education along with favorable changes in the economy aligned with labor market needs is expected to contribute to a reduction in the unemployment rate it is also expected that economic development will be encouraged as part of the revitalization of the declining areas regional differences in the republic of croatia will be eased by the planned implementation of measures that should contribute to balancing underdeveloped areas with the developed areas and provide both with social links e g long distance learning the eu is also dealing with regional differences as it implements its own guidelines and policies the republic of croatia will make use of designated eu funding to promote and develop economic policies and strengthen the social cohesion of less developed areas world bank national competitiveness council recommendations for increasing croatia s competitiveness education for growth and development http hr english publications recommendations pdf financing education the development of education in croatia will depend on the material investment that the republic of croatia is able to undertake in public expenditure accounted for over percent of the gdp which is a very high percentage compared to eu accession and candidate countries it is estimated that financing a more thorough and sustainable improvement of the educational system requires significant funding of which the most urgent emergency increase should amount to more than percent of the gdp the ministry of science education and the largest financial support to the education sector in addition to moses other ministries and local government also allocate funds for education thus when estimating the share of public education expenditures in gdp terms it is important to indicate all sources of financing in order to have a full picture for example the total budget of the ministry of science education and sports accounted for percent of the gdp in if we add the expenditures of the ministry of science education and sports to expenditures made by other central ministries and at the local level public education expenditures amounted to percent of the gdp in during the planning period the financing of education requires the monitoring of the actual share of funds in the state budget as well as estimates for potentially increasing the total amount of funds during the planning period it is necessary to define the financing of the education sector also by external funding sources funds for the education sector will steadily increase in order to approach allocations in european countries in order to ease the burden on state spending and include society in the education process businesses individuals and specialized employment agencies that wish to speed up the employment process can contribute to professional and vocational education globalization and accession to the eu the globalization of the economy means a more definitive division of labor and cooperation at the global level as well as growing competition changes in the employment structure and changes in the required knowledge and skills student and labor mobility are expected to increase with globalization these changes will also affect the education system thus taking into consideration the increasing opportunity for student mobility it is necessary to retain the participants in educational services at education and training institutions by offering them applicable lessons and high quality teaching in recent years the european union has substantially intensified its activities in the ministry of science education and sports statistics department education and research sectors although the real authority in these matters lies mainly with the member states through the exchange of good educational practices in fields such as teacher training basic foreign language skills information and communication technology finance management and counseling and informal learning and teaching with performance monitored by agreed indicators and benchmarks a coherent education and research sector is emerging in europe meanwhile croatia has to define its own profile in its own key knowledge areas international competition for talented pupils and students and teachers and researchers is gaining momentum croatia must provide its own educational and research systems that enable it to cooperate with others europe is pooling educational resources with a view toward strengthening its impact on the global level and croatia will soon be measured against the high standards of advanced eu countries accession to the european union includes the assumption that croatia has its own educational system and its quality is approaching the level of those in the member states globalization and the resulting inter dependence of the countries of the world has been accepted as a process in which national identity and national interests are not lost therefore a strategic document was prepared as the starting point for changes to the education system this document was the declaration on knowledge croatia based on knowledge and the application of knowledge by the croatian academy of sciences and arts of the development plan is also founded on the principles and goals of the lisbon declaration education and training until of this declaration calls on member countries to modernize their education systems to allow the eu to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world in the same way the development relies on the copenhagen declaration by the european ministers responsible for vocational education the plan is also influenced by the bologna declaration which relates to the establishment of europe as a unified area of higher education by which is of crucial importance for promoting the territorial and professional mobility of citizens and their search for employment the republic of croatia signed the bologna http europa eu int comm education index en html http www hazu hr pdf http europa eu int index en htm http europa eu int comm education copenhagen decla ration en

secondary schools as the basis for lifelong learning the practice of acquiring factual or a broad range of encyclopedic knowledge will be replaced by the development of comprehension skills problem solving and the practical application of knowledge that contribute to the quality of life of students in the modern world in order to modernize education in the broadest sense of the word information and communication technology ict will be used to provide for lifelong learning for all those interested especially those in preschool primary secondary and higher education and in the adult education

between education and the labor market scientific and technological development social changes and employment changes are the key reference points for the development of education learning while working becomes an exceptionally important form of professional training and innovations are frequently inter disciplinary as the result of team work in the education system therefore it is necessary to establish regional inter disciplinary networks which will provide the necessary cooperation between the education system researchers and the labor market linking education with the labor market is a key factor in forming a croatian education system which will be able to respond to market and social changes thereby increasing opportunities for employment for this reason it is necessary to develop a unified system of school based and professional guidance that is recognized in the eu countries as the tool of a unified policy of education and employment in the conception development and

of the internal management and the monitoring of the central regional and local institutions will determine the pace and extent of the planned changes the management and fiduciary capacities of the central administration as well as the regional education offices will be strengthened the decentralization of education management will be advanced to fall in line with regional needs and educational sector development strategy development of management strategies for an efficient educational system strengthening the management system a successful education system requires good administration and effective financing along with other management mechanisms an appropriate division of labor between decision makers and effective managers makes the implementation of educational policies possible amendments to legislation the devolution of power and the reform of the finance systems have increased the need for changes in educational administration especially with regard to evaluation and monitoring performance educational management at national regional and local levels as well as education at the institutional level will be developed in a coordinated manner to enable the short and medium term implementation of development measures and to support and promote the achievement of education policy targets in the long term target and results oriented management will be developed

importance of prioritizing education as an important element of future growth special attention should be dedicated to possible public private partnerships the goals are ensure that the state budget allocation for education as a percentage of gdp moves closer to european standards an adequate allocation of budget funds should be reserved to finance improvements in the education system special attention will be given to financing education in poorer regions and minority education especially for those who are integrated into society such as the roma population within budget limits state support should be extended to ensure support for adults who wish to complete their primary or secondary education and especially to those who need new qualifications and training for the labor market student financial support will be developed to give incentives for continuing education as the government cannot solely bear the financial burden new financing mechanisms and incentives will be supported for adult learning that encourage co investment by individuals and employers direct government subsidies will be earmarked primarily for those most in need measures for improving the monitoring of education information management is critical for the effective and timely management of the education system present day ministries have a key role in continuously following up on the
