the system of state maturity examinations was reorganized preparation for schools audit and monitoring of status of education has been started school libraries were modernized and a strategy for of education was formulated however many important works that are necessary to ensure quality of education remained not fulfilled through the lack of financial investments and human resources insufficient attention was devoted to the strengthening of basic schools teachers of these schools were not afforded sufficient opportunities for building their professional competencies equipment in the classrooms and the buildings themselves are outdated provision with modern teaching aids is poor in order to improve quality of education in the basic schools of lithuania the ministry of education and science prepared the education improvement project the implementation of this project is expected to be funded from a world bank loan it will be co financed by the government of the republic of lithuania and municipal funds the strategic lines of the project were approved by the government on october and included in the action plan of the government program for the education improvement project aims at solving the following current problems of education priority has been given to date to the structural reforms in upper secondary school the education improvement project now plans to focus upon basic education the reform of the basic school is of a paramount importance as it at this level that learning skills of pupils are developed and the basis for literacy and life long learning is laid down the basic school implements compulsory education from first form through tenth up till the age of sixteen as declared in the law on education hence the most important priority of the education improvement project is the improvement of the basic school while the curricula and structure of general education has changed insufficient investment has been made to improve the physical infrastructure most schools buildings do not comply with the modern requirements due to historically low levels of maintenance the lack of adequate thermal insulation makes schools energy inefficient a disproportionate amount of available funds is used for heating schools funds that could be better used to improve the quality of education the gap between the requirements of the curriculum and the provision of means necessary for teaching is widening one of the basic objectives of the education improvement project is to improve learning conditions at basic schools and to create a learning environment that meets contemporary standards in the ministry of education and science declared the basic priority to be the improvement of the quality of education thus one of the most immediate and urgent tasks is to create an efficient and effective management system for education so that decisions taken at all levels are based on reliable information the works of the reform lacked monitoring they were not consistently based on studies of education and societal change the educational supervisory system is not enough attuned to the improvement of the quality of teaching and learning there are too few incentives for schools to provide better quality educational services democratization of the society and the transition to the market economy together with accession to the european union imposes a need to review the principles objectives conditions and processes of education within the past decade the contents of general education were reorganized education standards and general curricula were created and the system of student assessment was reorganized however teachers who need to develop the critical thinking creativity communication and co operation skills of their pupils receive too little and inadequate professional training the purpose of the education improvement project is to arm the teachers of basic schools with the latest teaching learning strategies and methodologies to create enabling conditions where they will be able to use the best available methodologies technologies teaching materials and equipment one of the principal priorities of this period is rationalization of the school network currently the ministry of education and science is preparing guidelines to rationalize the network of educational institutions local governments the founders and managers of educational institutions are also very concerned about this issue irrational management of resources result in the fact that many vacant classrooms are being financed this costs the state about million litas yearly educational expenses per pupil vary among regions by as much as the education improvement project aims to strengthen the capacities of local governments to rationally manage the school network so that the desired quality of educational services is achieved access and retention is improved and that resources allocated to education are used as rationally as possible until there is an effective and efficient system of resource management the system will continue to be under and quality will continue to suffer goals objectives and
