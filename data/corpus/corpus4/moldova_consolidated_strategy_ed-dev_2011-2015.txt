european integration freedom democracy welfare www gov md xv re think moldova priorities for medium term development march www gov md demographic trends the total population of the republic of moldova has dropped by to inhabitants as a result of a downward trend that began to manifest in a cause of this phenomenon is the negative natural growth with subsequent effects and increase in the population ageing coefficient which increased from in to in this highlights the fact that the republic of moldova will enter the general trends of ageing of the population facing many countries with all implications of this phenomenon in terms of development of the educational sector with regard to the structure of the population by residential areas sex and age groups the situation is as follows i since there is a trend of considerable decline of population living in urban are and a growing proportion of the population living in rural areas thus according to the census of of the total population of the republic of moldova were located in the urban area and were located in rural areas compared with the data recorded in according to which of population lived in the urban area and of the population lived in rural areas urban population in turn has a high level of geographical concentration approximately is living in chisinau municipality in the population of the urban area constituted of the total population and the population form rural areas respectively ii according to statistics there were no significant changes in the structure of the population by sex male population representing in about in the total population or in while the share of the female population fell from in to in iii during there has been recorded a downward trend in the population of the age groups of and years old while there has been a slight growth in the age group of years old since there has began an increase in the number of population of the age groups of years old which require new approaches in the design of the network of institutions and services for early education and development the analysis of demographic trends on different age groups indicates that a relatively small number of school populations will be maintained in the coming years with immediate effects on the education institutions affecting mainly the primary schools and as well as the high schools in rural areas in the number of children aged years old was lower compared to by and respectively for the age group of years old in terms of education economy the reduction in the number of school population of the age group of years by about thousand in compared with hypothetically equals to the fact that the system would be completed with classes of pupils less if the average enrolment would be pupils which could lead to a reduction of approximately of teacher s posts the demographic situation has resulted in the decrease of the average number of pupils students in each class leading to ineffective use of the financial means allocated to education thus there are primary schools in the rural area of the total number of primary schools which have up to pupils in each class in case of there are institutions with up to pupils in each class of the total number of rural feasibility studies show that a great majority of such institutions might be by merging them with sector schools and in this way the annual savings would reach about mdl which could be used for education quality improvement economic trends moldova has passed a difficult transition period with a cumulative loss of gross domestic product gdp of approximately between and since the country s economy has shown a growing trend if during the acute economic collapse in the gdp declined by almost then in the gdp gained a real increase of about however the economy of the republic of moldova has proven to be vulnerable to the crisis in in real terms by the end of the gdp per capita was reduced by about this reduction imposed the need to redirect the available funds to meet the needs of the education system the strategic development issues to be resolved after the re launch of the moldovan economy in spite of economic difficulties the moldovan authorities have ensured a constant increase in the funds allocated to education over the past years thus over the share of public expenditure on education in the gdp increased from to however this growth has not been followed by an increase in the gross rate of enrolment at all levels of education however this increase was not followed by an increase in the gross enrolment rate at all education levels which decreased from to during the same period as a result of the economic crisis poverty has increased dramatically during then started to decline since on the one hand because of a certain economic growth recorded but also as a result of the increase in the phenomenon of migration of the workforce and the corresponding income sent from abroad in the country despite the fact that the extension of poverty has been stopped there are significant disparities between rural and urban areas which affect access to education thus in the highest rate of absolute poverty was recorded in rural areas which was followed by small towns in small cities the absolute poverty rate is almost two times higher than in larger cities qualitative and accessible education is essential to combat poverty in a sustainable manner thus according to data from the household s budget survey in the highest rate of absolute poverty is among households headed by persons without education or without primary education in the case of households headed by persons with incomplete secondary or primary education the absolute poverty rate is and in the case of households headed by persons with general secondary or secondary technical education in the case of households in which the head of the family has higher education the absolute poverty rate is the lowest in other words if the head of the family is illiterate or has no primary education the household s risk of being poor is seven times higher than of a household headed by a person who has higher education workforce and unemployment issues the transition of the republic of moldova to the market economy has produced quantitative and qualitative changes in the field of employment characterised in particular by i reduction of population employed in the national economy by almost ii increase in the share of employees in the private sector from in to about of the employed population in iii decrease in the number of partially employed persons iv increase in the number of persons employed in the informal sector v strengthening of labour migration vi insufficient use of intellectual potential in the level of unemployment among young people aged years old was or approximately three times higher than the average per country unemployment among young people is a particularly serious problem because it undermines the confidence of young people in the perspectives of the country the chances of creating a sustainable family the chances of personal affirmation the analysis of structure of the ilo unemployment by age group and level of education highlights the following issues vii high shares in the total number of unemployed has registered the age groups of and years old a feature that persists in the structure of the average residence and sex unemployed persons from among people with secondary vocational education recorded a share of in the total number of the unemployed aged years old those with technical secondary education and those with higher education ix high unemployment rate among youth graduates of vocational education institutions of all levels indicates along with other factors the inefficiency of the interactions between the education system the real economy and the labour market the analysis of the structure of the employed population by age groups and by level of education reveals that approximately of employed persons from the age group of years old have only general primary or secondary education being employed without having followed institutionalised professional training whereas the persons from the age group of years old have left the education system during the past years one may find that there are significant discrepancies by comparison between the general education and vocational education and the process of professional orientation and career guidance is inefficient access to education and the quality of education education in the republic of moldova is in a process of transition from a traditional system primarily informative and centralised to a modern dynamic formative one centred on pupils and students and specific to a democratic society based on market economy the basic indicators the operation of the education system in the republic of moldova are presented in annex according to the

and specialised secondary education consists of craft schools vocational schools vocational high schools and colleges the evolution of enrolment in secondary vocational education institutions in denotes a decrease in the number of pupils enrolled thus the number of pupils enrolled in was by less compared to that of although the share of secondary school graduates who were continuing their education in secondary vocational education was maintaining relatively at the same level about during those years the number of pupils in vocational schools was dropping an increase in the number of pupils enrolled in the vocational education institutions was registered since this growth is ensured by active interventions of the authorities i increasing the number of places for enrolment in vocational schools concurrently decreasing the number of places in higher education ii increasing the budget appropriations for secondary vocational education the average expenditures per pupil in increased almost twice compared with iii updating the nomenclature of trades in accordance with economic needs of the country through the inclusion of some new trades of the total number of trades and modernisation of the existing trades iv increasing scholarships by beginning of october v granting certain incentives to pupils in the vocational schools free of charge nutrition places in dormitory vi partial modernisation of the material and technical basis of education institutions to revitalise the secondary vocational and specialised education the ministry of education with the assistance of external donors has implemented several projects the main of which are i development of the training and professional training system in moldova funded by sida ii moldovan occupational standards evaluation and certification funded by sdc iii ada project implemented by the austrian organization iv consolidate the system of vocational and technical education in moldova supported by liechtenstein development service foundation in spite of efforts made some crafts in the secondary vocational education in rural areas are still unattractive for secondary general education graduates therefore at the beginning of the school year pupils were enrolled in secondary vocational education institutions registering a decrease by compared to the previous school year the majority of pupils most of which come from rural settlements were enrolled based on gymnasium education the main challenges facing the secondary vocational education are i the material and technical basis is morally outdated in some institutions ii the decrease in the number of crafts professions from to during iii lack of a system of teaching aids development and publishing for the secondary vocational education iv shortage of teachers with higher education for technical subjects in secondary vocational education institutions v lack of system of continuous training of teachers for technical subjects in secondary vocational education institutions vi ineffective mechanisms of interaction between secondary vocational education institutions and business community local communities and the labour market vii ineffective use of available material and technical basis and allocated financial means insufficient financing of secondary vocational education during the evolution of the specialised secondary education institutions colleges was controversial for a certain period they were included in the higher education level their transformation into short term higher education institutions had a profound impact on educational offers teaching learning methods composition of teaching staff and the attractiveness of studies for gymnasium secondary school and high school graduates in there were operating specialised secondary education institutions of which private in which there were pupils the trends in the field of specialised secondary education were felt to the same extent in the secondary vocational education thus during the number of pupils in the specialised secondary education decreased by almost a recovery of the situation was felt only during overall the increase in the number of pupils in the specialised secondary education from in the school year up to in the school year is mainly explained by the fact that after the redefinition of the level of education offered such institutions have begun to register more secondary school graduates the enrolment plan was increased by in compared with the challenges faced by the specialised secondary education are i uncertainties regarding colleges status and position in education system ii college abandonment by a part of pupils who passed the professional graduation examination baccalaureate to continue their education in higher education institutions iii morally outdated material basis especially of colleges with technical profile iv lack of regulations on nomenclature of specialties offered by colleges based on occupational fields of the national economy v ineffective use of available material and technical basis and allocated financial means vi ineffective mechanisms of interaction between colleges and business community local communities and labour market the analysis of programmes of studies and educational offers of the specialised secondary education institutions shows that relevant these institutions must be assigned to the post secondary vocational education level which requires a clear definition of their role in the education system of the republic of moldova and ensuring the continuity between the adjacent educational levels secondary vocational education and higher education higher education the processes of education system reform were much more pronounced in the field of higher education in the context of a decrease in the number of population the number of students in higher educational institutions has grown continually from in the school year to in the school year later on the number of students began to fall reaching out students in the school year the decrease in the number of students has been caused both by reducing the number of secondary education graduates as well as by excessive regulations imposed on candidates for enrolment to education the higher education system ensures the preparation of specialists in approximately specialities in the context of the economic growth of the last years this trend is rising steadily but surely having evaluated the students group from the quantity perspective we have found that their number has almost doubled over the past decade thus in there were students per inhabitants while in data indicate approximately students subsequently this indicator fell its value dropping to students per inhabitants overall higher education is becoming increasingly accessible and age limitations are mitigated similarly the large number of students in higher education compared with the much smaller number of students in the secondary vocational and specialised secondary education shows that higher education is a priority for the citizens of the republic of moldova we emphasis the fact that the share of seats with funding from the state budget for the enrolment in higher education institutions have increased steadily during with the following dynamic in the school year and in the school year the effects of the crisis have forced the authorities to reduce this indicator in to but this reduction will be a temporary one maintaining a relatively high number of students the education of which is financed from the state budget reveals a trend of increasing access to and equity in education especially for children from poor families at the same time we must mention that the regulatory authorities shall carry out a direct enrolment in the secondary vocation education institutions secondary technical education and higher education institutions working out plans for the enrolment for both the state and private institutions these plans should cover both the enrolment for studies financed from the state budget as well as the enrolment of students based on contract providing that a part of costs will be covered by the students consequently the number of students enrolled in higher education institutions fell from in the school year to in the school year at the same time there has been a certain increase in the number of pupils and students enrolled in the secondary vocational education and secondary technical education institutions over the past six years the authorities have taken measures needed for the implementation of the bologna process requirements the restructuring of the higher education into two cycles bachelor s degree cycle i and master s degree cycle ii the introduction of credits system in higher education institutions the development and implementation of a new nomenclature of areas and specialised professional training however whereas the phd has not become the cycle iii of the higher education in the republic of moldova yet the reform of higher education has not provided a full consistency with the bologna process requirements the main activities carried out by the authorities in the field of higher education were i improvement of legal and normative framework in accordance with the bologna process requirements ii implementation of
