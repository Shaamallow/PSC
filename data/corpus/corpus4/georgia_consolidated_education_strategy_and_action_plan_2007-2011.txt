for all strategy for the education sector a introduction prospects for education and for the economy are closely inter related georgian economic growth has been fast in the past few years real gdp growth rate was per cent in and per cent in but the legacy of the first sixteen years of transition continues to constrain the rate at which the quantity and quality of education can be improved of all the transition economies georgia is second only to moldova in the severity of the transformational recession that it suffered in the early s real gdp fell to its lowest point in in spite of the recent revival recovery over the whole period has lagged behind that of its neighbors and other countries in the region as a result georgia s average standard of living as measured by gdp per head in us adjusted for purchasing power parity ppp was lower in than that of any country in the europe and central asia region except tajikistan uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and moldova imf world economic outlook database as the economy contracted the resources available to government fell even more total government expenditure was equivalent to less than per cent of gdp in compared with per cent in implying a real fall of per cent over this period unicef database since government revenue and expenditure have increased see table below but georgia is still one of five countries in the cis classified as highly indebted total external debt was around million in and public and publicly guaranteed debt service obligations were million imf a tables and about per cent of government revenue squeezing the public resources available for other purposes including education poverty also spread during the s the recent review of poverty in the region by the world bank found that per cent of georgians earned less than ppp per day in a proportion exceeded by only tajikistan and kyrgyzstan since then the national statistics department has found that the poverty rate continued to increase in and a marked improvement occurred in early particularly in rural areas but the poverty problem is still severe government of georgia in these circumstances it is not surprising that a significant proportion of georgians seek work abroad on one estimate between and were working abroad in the early s of whom around in russia remittances were estimated at million in equivalent to around per cent of gdp per cent of foreign direct investment and per cent of exports of goods and services another important context for education strategy is the downward trend in the number of young people of school age between and the number of year olds is estimated to have fallen by per cent that of year olds by per cent and that of year olds by per cent and of year olds by per cent between and as table shows even though the number of year olds shows signs of stabilizing further falls in the number of year olds by per cent year olds by per cent and year olds by per cent are expected table projections of school age population by age group source calculated from unicef database based on national statistics department estimates of population by single year age group education can play an important role in improving the competitiveness of the economy currently dependent on low income agriculture and unsustainable exports such as scrap metal and aircraft repair services the imf finds that while georgia still ranks lowest among the countries in the region in the global competitiveness report world economic forum there is evidence of improvement in a range of indicators of business conditions and competitiveness since thanks to the drive against corruption it recommends continued structural reforms as well as prudent macroeconomic and flexible exchange rate policies imf more dynamically and for the longer run these will be supplemented by improvements in the quantity and quality of education which could transform the factor endowment of the economy shifting its comparative advantage away from products and services based on natural resources and cheap relatively unskilled labor towards skill based products and services international evidence including cross country and many country case studies is consistent with this hypothesis which implies an active role for education in changing economic prospects as ireland has shown in the past twenty years a high quality education system is one of the pre conditions for a small economy with a history of chronic labor export to transform itself and find a prosperous niche within europe b an overview of education reform so far the scope and pace of georgian education reform since are unique in the region in particular reforms of financing and governance of educational institutions that other countries have been grappling with for years have been initiated at a stroke they introduce the per capita financing principle of money follows the student in both general and higher education the state undertakes to provide twelve years of free general education and primary basic and general schools which have been converted from local government budget organizations to autonomous legal entities of public law or are funded directly from the ministry of education and science receiving an amount per pupil a voucher which varies only according to the location of the school highest for those in highlands lowest for those in cities and covers current but not capital expenditures small schools can receive an extra amount per pupil from the central budget and extra educational and teaching services and special educational curricula can be financed locally each school has a board of trustees composed of elected teachers and parents a student representative and in some cases a local government nominee which elects the school director approves the budget and oversees and advises school management the lump sum amount received from the moes paid into the school s own bank account can be spent in any way that school management approved by the board decides subject only to a minimum salary rate for teachers depending on their qualifications experience and the number of pupils see the law of georgia on general education april for the overall framework and decree n of the government of georgia october for details of the funding formula per class local education departments have been replaced by education resource centers which facilitate but do not control schools educational activities by collecting data conducting research organizing training workshops and seminars etc per student funding model has been applied to higher education he within this model upper limit of tuition fees is set for state universities but not for private ones and this upper limit equals the highest amount of grant issued by the state uniform grants to a relatively small number of students have been replaced by grants on a sliding scale to a larger number but still merit based and a student loan scheme has been initiated in cooperation with commercial banks in line with georgia s admission to the bologna process a three cycle degree system has been adopted the he management system has been changed making heis autonomous bodies and their heads are no longer appointed by the president but elected by each institution s academic council the highest representative body consisting of elected professors from each department a crucial contribution to reduction in corruption and reform of higher education admission has been made by the introduction of unified entrance examinations held in and using sophisticated testing methods across a range of subjects these are administered by a new agency the national examination center under the governance of but at arm s length from the moes on both occasions the conduct of the examinations was monitored by transparency international in its report on the examinations together with the american councils for international education the testing process was judged to be well organized and transparent wide support for the new system was found throughout the country and a large majority of test takers parents and administrators felt confident that it would help to eliminate corruption in university admission transparency international together with university admission examinations the agency is administering other examinations as teacher certification international student examinations etc similar management model has been established and relevant agencies have been set up in other areas important to quality assurance and control the national education accreditation center established in march is responsible for carrying out the accreditation of higher education institutions the number of authorized heis has already been reduced through a courageous two step institutional accreditation process from in to current the center intends to extend accreditation to general and vocational schools and is developing criteria for this purpose as well as encouraging a process of self evaluation the national curriculum and assessment center established in april has introduced new curricula designed to encourage active learning rather than mechanical transfer of knowledge at first in grades and and on a pilot basis in grades and authors have developed new textbooks in response to the new curricula a textbook rental scheme has been piloted but not implemented nationally the teachers professional development center established in july aims to develop standards and qualification requirements for teachers to conduct a process of accreditation of teacher training and retraining programs and to introduce a system of teacher certification after many years of attention to in service training reform of pre career training is regarded as the greater challenge see the law of georgia on higher education december depending on their scores in the new unified entrance examinations next paragraph for detailed discussion see national assessment and examinations center chapter for a review of the unified examinations process see see ministry of education and science for more detail georgian national scientific foundation was established in july in order to support scientific and technological researches through the distribution of state grants on competitive basis the moes is implementing state educational policy through the activities of the agencies described above as well as through various programs these include physical rehabilitation of schools and ict development childcare and programs civic integration and state and native language support programs national contests for pupils an ambitious program known as the deer leap program was launched in march with the aim of providing every school with computers internet access educational software and services and technical support upgrading the ict skills of teachers and students integrating ict into the curriculum through computer aided instruction in a wide range of subjects and of the education management information system emis at school local and national levels this four year program is modeled on the estonian tiger leap program and managed by a foundation and the board consisting of representatives of government the parliament civil society business associations university academics and teachers the budget of the program over four years totals gel million additional million have been contributed by donors in the task of this program is extensive and challenging considering the fact that in before the program started the student to computer normally second hand computer ratio in general schools was at the same time major improvements have been made for physical rehabilitation of schools for the first time during the last years general schools were rehabilitated and new schools were built within the president s national program for school building rehabilitation the program will spend over gel million on restoration and repair work over the next four years another area of innovation is vocational education a recently adopted law on vocational education regulates initial vocational education activities of the national professional agency curricula and management of vets according to the law the national professional agency will create national qualifications and accreditation system and vocational education standards will be developed by the national curriculum and assessment center in parallel the moes has started the process of rehabilitation vocational training schools schools have been rehabilitated and opened in the moes is planning to optimize the network of existing vocational schools and rehabilitate the best ones in the coming two years professional higher education reshaped to respond to labor market demands will take place in he institutions it will be regulated by the law of georgia on higher education and integrated into he area in some areas development of new approaches is still at a relatively early stage in early childhood care and education the need to address the issue of school readiness among year olds is recognized through development of regulatory policies including flexible financial systems operational protocols and professional standards legal changes and national pre and in service teacher training curricula ministry of education and science a children and abandonment prevention program implemented jointly by the moes with donor support been aiming at the reduction of the number of children see ministry of education and science for more detail deprived of parental and family care in special institutions in order to help such children be better integrated in social life the activities of the program include reorganization of childcare institutions and creation of alternative family and parent support services for children with special educational needs a pilot project for the introduction of inclusive education in general schools is being mounted in ten schools in tbilisi this involves development of a national policy for inclusive education preparation of training modules adaptation of the physical teaching and social environment of the selected schools training of disabled children and their parents introduction of inclusive teaching under the supervision of an elected coordinator publication of a manual establishment of libraries increasing public awareness and monitoring and evaluation ministry of education and science a policy is also addressing the particular educational problems of ethnic linguistic minorities in the regions the biggest of which is inability to speak the state language a textbook on georgian as a second language has been produced for non georgian schools in armenian and azeri incentives for qualified georgian language teachers to work in minority schools have been provided under a short term program while long term goals are to be pursued through teacher training and human resource development programs in order to provide equal access to he representatives of minority groups together with other citizens belonging to vulnerable groups are offered an opportunity to attend free preparatory courses for unified national admission examinations another benefit offered to such students is the provision of state social grants to cover tuition fees at universities the speed with which education reforms were initiated after owes much to the ground that had been laid since by the education system realignment and strengthening program since renamed the ilia project financed by a world bank credit of million the new financing formula and funding mechanisms the outcome based national curriculum for general schools the national assessment and examinations system and the system for professional development of teachers were all tools developed by this project ready for use when the political moment arrived the project also financed improvements in textbooks including the piloted but not yet implemented rental scheme and the establishment of an emis the second phase of the project continues the development of the curriculum the assessment system and teachers professional development but devotes per cent of its budget to improving the physical learning environment in schools among other donor agencies usaid in its million general education decentralization and accreditation geda project is helping to build up the new system of regional management and educational support the education resource centers mentioned above to develop and a quality assurance and accreditation system for general vocational and higher education and to increase capacity within the moes to manage the new systems usaid has also provided technical assistance for establishment of the new initial vocational education centers gtz and the eu have been involved in assistance to vocational education and the eu is financing changes in selected higher education institutions through its tempus program european training foundation in addition the moes actively seeks defined by the moes to include children with disabilities and handicaps members of ethnic minorities street children children with social problems children with emotional disorders speech and behavior problems and girls who have problems of access to and retention in schools advice and support for smaller scale programs though bilateral donors and un agencies and works closely with the ngo community c principles underlying education strategy the government of georgia has acknowledged the international evidence discussed above on the importance of education for the development of economic competitiveness of a small country the main goal of the development of educational system is the creation of knowledge based society and economy through providing to each citizen the opportunity of full realization of his her potential regardless of age ethnicity or social standing the following are the strategies to be pursued in order to achieve this goal democratization of management processes and the active involvement of society into the process decentralization of the system of management and guarantee of independence and autonomy to educational institutions promotion of outcome oriented management in the educational sector through the introduction of relevant quality management schemes and mechanisms for resource distribution an increase in the amount of funding provided for the education sector and development of its material technical basis improvement of educational contents at every level in order to ensure positive learning and labor market outcomes integration of education and science with international trends and development of educational and scientific centers in higher educational institutions the extensive and radical education reform program since the beginning of described in the previous section has been part of this strategy state policy on education during the reforms has been aimed at improving governance and funding mechanisms for education granting autonomy to educational institutions deregulation decentralization of the system improving learning and labor market outcomes of educational programs the ultimate goal of the reform is to establish a system which will ensure the provision of highly qualified self reliant and internationally competitive human resources leading the country to poverty reduction social welfare and economic growth thus the education reforms in georgia are based on the globally acknowledged principles of a knowledge based society and economy more specifically a number of action lines have been identified in the course of educational restructuring these action lines are as follows increase and diversify sources of income and financing provide an appropriate regulatory framework eradicate corruption intensify international cooperation involve all the major stakeholders in education planning and management assure the sustainability of the system by providing life long and life wide learning opportunities maintain high quality education training and research by means of academic freedom institutional autonomy and peer review the conceptual legislative and structural basis for the system has been established currently the following are identified as medium term outcomes expected through the realization of the sector action plan sustainability since the institutional foundations of the process are already in place the introduction of relevant legal mechanisms for transparency and accountability as a next step can ensure the sustainability of the system this in its turn will provide for compatibility and of georgian education with international educational systems social inclusion the implementation of various programs and projects will maximize the inclusion of the citizens of georgia in education this on the one hand will reduce social injustice due to unequal opportunities and on the other will provide essential resources for further development of the system competitiveness in order to ensure high quality of education competitiveness shall be encouraged at three levels individual institutional and national the system of education will be involved in the european system on an equal basis with other countries and with enough capacity to compete with them d components of the strategy i pre school education and early childhood development the early years of life are increasingly considered throughout the world as the right time for investing in a child s development equipping children below school age with relevant life skills prepares them for school education and supports their early socialization another important rationale for developing early childhood care and education is to provide support for parents involvement in social life currently the pre primary education sector in georgia is to a large extent underdeveloped as in some other post communist countries pre primary education system collapsed in the early s since then this level of education unlike other levels has not been through an extensive reform process therefore there is an urgent need to introduce substantial changes in this sector legislative as well as structural and operational the reorganization of pre primary education carried out in was aimed at the decentralization of the system which was previously centrally governed as a result local self management units became responsible for the establishment of pre school educational institutions approval of their statutes and appointment of a person responsible for the representation and control of their affairs however currently there is certain confusion over the management and organization of pre school education there are no principles of management and control in place the role and extent of involvement of central government are largely undefined funding mechanisms for pre school education have not yet been devised and there is no standard licensing procedure eca human development discussion paper series europe and central asia region the world bank june unfavorable economic conditions caused a sharp decrease in the amount of funding available for pre school institutions resulting in halving of their number between and table a number of private kindergartens have been established especially in urban areas from early s which makes it very difficult to make an accurate estimate of the number of children enrolled in pre primary education the absence of standard licensing procedure allows these institutions operate informally and remain unregistered table number of public kindergartens and number of children enrolled year number of kindergartens number of children enrolled source national department of statistics of georgia although there is disparity in the data provided by different sources on pre school enrollment rates all of them testify that the rate has dropped sharply starting from early s as figure shows figure pre primary enrollment rates georgia unicef databases geographical and social factors affect pre school enrollment rates in this figure as a percentage of year olds and disparities are observed in this respect enrollment rates in rural areas are at a rough estimate three times lower than those in urban areas figure figure pre primary enrolment rates urban and rural compared and urban rural total source department of statistics of georgia access to pre school also depends on family income as figure shows only per cent of year olds from the poorest families attended pre school in compared with per cent of those from the richest families a pattern that was similar to that in every other country shown this is partly because private kindergartens charge fees that are too high for poor families figure attendance rate year olds by household consumption level georgia compared with some other transition countries top bottom belarus macedonia albania ukraine georgia serbia fyr montenegro source unicef forthcoming based on mics provisional results scarcity of financial resources has resulted in the deterioration of pre school infrastructure according to the estimates of the national department of statistics of georgia out of public pre school institutions functioning in georgia in needed capital repair and were in emergency conditions schools lack such essential facilities as heating roofing and educational materials similar problems are apparent in educational programs and teaching methods staff qualifications are not adequate georgia is currently in the initial phase of formulating a national strategy for early childhood development ecd in recognition of the universally acknowledged importance of expanding and improving comprehensive early childhood care and education efa goal no unicef is providing extensive technical and expert support in this process a comprehensive model will be set up for pre school education and early childhood care the principles of organization and management will be clearly defined within the model as well as mechanisms of funding the model will contain clear delineation of rights and responsibilities of local and central governments in the management and control of pre schools although responsibility for management of pre school institutions lies with local governments central government will be involved in developing normative framework for ece specifically tasks and responsibilities of the moes will include establishing standards for ece providing support in the introduction and implementation of standards assuring ece quality an important factor for supporting smooth performance of pre school education system will be the introduction of a feasible and efficient funding scheme that will enable it to reach those pre school age children who are currently not attending there is an agreement that inputs to funding will be made jointly by local municipalities and central government state policy towards developing pre school education will be focused on providing assistance to those experiencing financial problems thus reflecting social needs of population in order to eliminate both geographical and social discrepancies in access in accordance with the national social assistance policy pre school education immediately prior to grade one will be subsidized for year olds from the socially most vulnerable families the urgent need to reach the neediest layers of population will be met by the development and introduction of diversified forms of ece community based centers daycare centers family and parent education sunday schools etc which will be easily accessible for all as well as the development and provision of learning material for about per cent of children in these age groups who otherwise do not have access to such resources a crucial area for further development of ece is improvement in the quality of learning achievement this will be done through improving teacher qualifications and development of curriculum and learning material for pre school education ii general education the state provides a free twelve year general education for all its citizens general education in georgia consists of primary grades to lower secondary to and upper secondary stages to it is regulated by the law of georgia on general education basic nine year education is compulsory the three stages are regarded as one general level in the system of education in georgia i e there is no separate primary schooling system management and funding per capita funding as described in section b of this chapter is common for a general school comprising the three stages therefore funding allocated for general is between primary lower secondary and upper secondary education with the of students enrolled in each of these stages in accordance with the national goals of general education adopted by the government of georgia in october as well as international obligations and commitments assumed by the country the general education system aims at developing all its citizens as free individuals equipped with essential mental and physical skills and capacities nurturing civil consciousness based on democratic and liberal values the state is committed to achieving this goal through using the following tools policy and legislation on general education the general education schooling system general education regulation and quality assurance mechanisms the national curriculum the following are the major objectives to be achieved by in general education ensure openness of general education and equal access for all integrate the georgian general education system into the international educational area introduce national assessment curricula development and accreditation systems in general education ensure efficient and effective governance of general secondary schools ensure more equitable use of all necessary educational physical and financial resources ensure autonomous governance of schools ensure the support to inclusive education structure and governance the education reform program referred to in the previous sections has laid solid legislative and structural foundations for all of the aspects referred to above at this stage it is crucial to ensure sustainability and long term efficiency of the structures and practices that are already in place and further improvement of the system this can be done by laying emphasis on the following three areas capacity building information management monitoring and evaluation first of all the need for reliable and accurate statistical data and information on expenditure requires improvement in the capacity of school directors and administrators in the principles of autonomous school governance financial accountability managing budgets handling financial information fundraising liaison with communities etc school boards of trustees will also receive training on the nature of their responsibility and the skills needed to exercise it general education territorial management reform carried out in has been important for improving governance of general education instead of previously existing educational departments with double accountability both to local and central governments are established in each district as the moes territorial units facilitating activities of the schools located in the district recruitment and training of the heads and staff of rehabilitation and equipment of erc buildings was carried out by usaid support through general education decentralization and accreditation program all will be rehabilitated and equipped and staff trained in it is crucial to ensure that information is communicated freely between three levels of governance schools moes at central and erc levels electronic databases containing the following information will be established operational and regularly updated at all levels agreed statistics on the number of pupils enrolled in and attending each grade by sex and age statistics for each level and type on number of teachers non teachers class sizes institution sizes etc statistics for each level and type on total consolidated expenditure public central public local extra budgetary broken down by personnel teachers personnel non teachers utilities subsidies and transfers other current and capital expenditure statistics for each level and type on sources of revenue broken down by central government local government and extra budgetary distinguishing between fees sale of goods and services donors etc together with building the capacity of administrators at all levels it is essential to ensure that all the activities and measures taken are followed by the appropriate monitoring and evaluation procedure at all levels school and the moes and that outcomes of activities meet the targets set in advance enrollment and access as a country committed to the performance of millennium development and efa goals georgia will seek to ensure that enrollment rates in general education do not decline and equal access to education is guaranteed to all children table shows the enrollment rates recorded by the education management information system for table general school enrollment rates in total male female school enrollment primary gross school enrollment basic gross school enrollment secondary gross total male female school enrollment primary net school enrollment basic net school enrollment secondary net source emis national department of statistics in line with efa goal no efforts will be focused on providing increased opportunities of learning for representatives of certain vulnerable groups key concerns that have to be addressed in terms of eliminating inequalities in access to education and achievement are those related to unequal distribution of income geographical distribution and ethnic minorities a drive to increase enrollment rates and improve quality at this level to the benefit of productivity and international competitiveness will concentrate on children belonging to these disadvantaged categories specifically enrollment efforts will focus on the members of the following disadvantaged groups a minority population currently there are non georgian schools and non georgian sectors of instruction at schools in georgia with students languages of instruction in these schools and sectors are russian armenian azeri and of these schools are located in and two regions densely populated by armenian and azeri populations respectively quality of general education in these schools is low due to several reasons firstly there is the lack of qualified teaching staff especially in remote areas where majority of these schools are located further inadequate knowledge of georgian as a state language hinders the process of their social inclusion and civic integration the ministry of education and science through cooperation with donor agencies has introduced a set of initiatives in order to ensure individual and collective right of members of minorities to use their native language preserve and express their cultural values on one hand and on the other to provide them with teaching state language for this purpose in december the moes started its civil integration program it aims to solve the problem of teaching language facilitate the process of social integration and raise public awareness through teaching the state language to all the citizens of georgia through the following activities elaboration of new teaching programs and standards for learning the georgian language and literature as well as recommendations and organization of teacher training financial support for teaching the georgian language in non georgian schools of is provided by the osce high commissioner on national minorities programs have been implemented through cooperation with this agency during two years two in georgian language both in and and two in native armenian and azeri languages in each of the two regions respectively creation of an appropriate learning environment as well as an effective system of teaching and knowledge assessment within the framework of secondary school reforms support for the integration of non georgian teachers and students through partnership projects between non georgian and georgian schools provision of georgian textbooks books magazines and newspapers to non georgian schools encouragement of participation in the unified national university admission examinations and preparation of non georgian applicants for the exams in georgian language and literature in the medium term perspective it is planned to proceed with implementing some of the activities described above necessary to give equal opportunities to quality education for minorities particularly preparatory courses for admission exams and state grants to cover tuition fees at heis will continue to be offered to the students who finish non georgian schools however more attention will be drawn to designing and implementing long impact and measures with sustainable results special general education curricula are being designed and introduced in non georgian schools and sectors of instructions special emphasis will be placed on developing capacity and strengthen human resource potential in the regions densely populated by minorities to provide equal opportunities for access to quality education for national minorities special pre service and in service training programs will be developed for teachers in the regions densely populated by national minorities in addition to this incentive schemes for students enrolled in initial teacher education ite programs and teachers will increase the motivation of young people to apply to these programs and be committed to work in minority schools b people living in high mountainous areas another group potentially deprived of quality education is the population of high mountainous regions and conflict zones currently students study in schools located in such regions in order to ensure adequate quality of education in these schools they are entitled to receive highest amount of voucher funding per head in addition small schools can also receive extra funding per student the plan is to further refine the per capita funding formula to reflect the individual needs of schools of all sizes due to the lack of qualified teaching staff in high mountainous regions it is important to introduce an appropriate system of incentives at university teacher education programs to attract young and motivated professionals to such regions one more area of the reform program where additional measures will be taken to ensure efficiency is the ongoing school optimization process which has been designed in two stages and has reduced the number of public general schools by almost although this has improved fiscal efficiency additional challenges have emerged that will be addressed specifically those connected with the access of children to schools located at remote distances in order to address this problem free transportation opportunity is offered to students school buses were purchased by the moes and were donated to schools however due to high demand it is planned to purchase more to ensure that children do not experience any difficulties in access c groups affected by other social factors within the medium term expenditure framework the social dimension will be given appropriate consideration consistent with the nationwide social assistance policy benefits will be offered to the families identified as the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and hence unable to provide a proper educational environment for children quality increasing the quality of general education has been and still is a crucial part of the education sector reform program the drive for georgia to integrate with european education systems implies a need to bring the general education system of the country up to international standards quality improvement will be focused on two aspects i the content and ii the learning environment at schools a number of measures have already been taken and more are planned in order to improve quality in terms both of learning and knowledge outcomes and of relevance and labor market outcomes a the prime responsibility for quality assurance is with a school itself at the national level quality assurance and control are implemented by the moes through the agencies under its governance the national curriculum and assessment center national examination center national education accreditation center and teachers professional development center the newly established national curriculum and assessment center develops national educational curricula which include achievement standards and recommended learning programs these are based on the national goals of general education all public and private schools are obliged to meet national curriculum goals and criteria while being free to design part of the curriculum on their own schools are free to choose the form and content of study within the curriculum framework but the state has the means to measure achievement and if needed can participate in improving the quality of learning piloting of the national curriculum started in and was implemented throughout the country in the academic year in three grades new curricula and textbooks are first piloted and then introduced in each subsequent class introduction of national curricula will be complete at lower and upper secondary levels in and at primary level in professional development of teachers is high on the agenda in the education sector action plan important measures that have already been introduced include the establishment of the teacher professional development center preparation of a concept paper on teacher s professional development and preparation and introduction of amendments to the law of georgia on general education laying legal basis for regulating the teacher s profession the teachers professional development center aims to develop standards and qualification requirements for teachers to conduct a process of accreditation of teacher training and retraining programs and to introduce a system of teacher certification by currently after many years of paying predominant attention to in service training reform of pre career training is regarded as the greater challenge and area where further investments and improvements are needed pre service teacher training programs at higher education institutions are obsolete overloaded with theoretical issues and lacking exercises for the development of teaching skills therefore initial teacher education ite programs will be designed and introduced at georgian universities in the capital as well as in regions crucial factor for ensuring high quality in teaching at schools is low teacher salaries thus reducing their incentives general schools are now autonomous entities this means schools themselves bear responsibility for establishing teacher salary rates given that they observe minimal rate recommended by the moes this system automatically implies that the rise of salaries will depend on the amount of per capita funding available for each school and on the decision of school board and management as annual increase of per capita funding is planned it is expected that at current teacher salaries will increase by in thus making it possible to make teacher s profession more attractive in addition results of teacher examination and certification process will help offer better compensation to those teachers who are better qualified and accordingly raise motivation of teachers in order to adequately assess the outcomes of accomplished and ongoing changes appropriate monitoring and evaluation procedures will be established at every level for assuring and controlling quality at school level all general schools will develop quality assurance mechanisms and tools for self evaluation to be monitored by district the moes will evaluate the compliance of learning process and outcomes with national curricula and development standards through a general school accreditation process carried out by the national accreditation center of georgia in order to ensure that learning outcomes of general school students are measurable nationally as well as internationally they will be assessed through national assessments administered by the national curriculum and assessment center as well as through participation in international assessment programs and to compare performance of georgian students with learning achievement of their foreign peers b the second major means of increasing the quality of education is the improvement of learning environment at schools efforts have been focused on two major areas rehabilitation of physical infrastructure and the introduction of ict in general education due to the fact that no capital rehabilitation works of general schools had been carried out in georgia for almost a decade schools were in extremely poor physical conditions and in need of substantial rehabilitation and refurbishment the president s national program for school building rehabilitation was designed to address this need within the scope of this program public schools have been fully rehabilitated new schools have been built and partial rehabilitation works has been carried out in schools the country in all schools will be fully or partially rehabilitated within this program planned to last for four years apart from rehabilitating physical infrastructure appropriate measures will be taken to provided up to date learning material and facilities to general schools within the framework of school deer leap program it is planned that general schools in georgia will be equipped with computers and will have internet access by upon completion of the program student to computer ratio is expected to be it was secondhand computers per student before the program started furthermore ict will be integrated into the national curriculum and used for teaching other subjects by the end of all public schools in georgia including highland villages will have internet access and educational internet network will be created by the end of the educational network was projected by deer leap and provider companies were selected on competitive basis encouraging them to advance and improve their services and thus contributing to the development of ict infrastructure in the country training of teachers in ict technologies is also part of the program of all teachers will have basic ict skills by the end of and will be able to train others iii vocational education vocational education has been another priority area for improvement and development within the wide scale education reform program the new concept of vocational education places it within the framework of life long learning it aims at setting up proper institutional framework and network of vocational training centers colleges and training programs responding to contemporary requirements and growing demand on the labor market it is expected that enrollment in vocational education which compares with some of the successful western countries will increase through providing high quality courses corresponding to international standards and thus improving chances of employment on the labor market on the other hand the enrollment rate in upper secondary education is currently estimated at per cent gross thus there is the need to provide opportunities for professional development for those who leave schools after the completion of basic level vocational education will be offered to school leavers as well as to those who stay in schools at upper secondary level through providing vocational training courses at general schools currently vocational education is not in a position to attract young people the share of vocational education in the total number of enrolled in upper secondary education is considerably lower than observed in some other countries in the region and eu countries figure figure vocational technical as of total upper secondary enrollment georgia in a regional context azerbaijan armenia georgia eu baltic central asia bulgaria eu cee romania source unicef database a major recent development in vocational education recently has been the elaboration of a legislative framework in particular the concept of vocational education and a draft law of georgia on vocational education the following have been identified as major goals of vocational education in the country to meet the professional and educational demands of the population support professional development to prepare adequately qualified professionals for the internal as well as the external labor market to support the competitiveness of workforce through retraining and qualification improvement programs to support adaptation to new socio economic conditions through private business and self employment initiatives vocational education will acquire a special role for development of georgia s regions the potential medium term benefits of establishing vocational training centers will include the reduction of the intensity of migration and support of the economic development of regions this will be done through the identification of specific economic development priorities local business perspectives and employment opportunities within each region in the process of planning the recently adopted law of georgia on vocational education sets out the institutional and organizational framework that will help achieve these goals the new system will consist of initial vocational and professional higher education initial vocational education will be offered by vocational training centers while accredited heis will be offering professional higher education to be regulated by the law of georgia on higher education a network of community colleges will also be established in the regions on the basis of existing institutes and colleges one of the most efficient ways of improving the governance of vocational training centers as well as labor market outcomes is fostering cooperation and partnership with the private sector and the government stakeholders the national professional agency responsible for the elaboration and approval of the list of professional qualifications and professional standards will be composed of the representatives of ministries professional associations employers associations and vocational schools and colleges educational entrepreneurial partnerships will be strengthened through the establishment of professional councils composed of employers professional associations and line ministries each vocational training center will be governed by a supervisory board consisting of the representatives of employers and local self government units as well as teachers and parents in order to ensure efficient funding of vocational education voucher funding the money follows the student approach will be introduced instead of allocating lump sums to individual institutions funding will be provided on a per capita basis the size of the voucher will vary according to and will reflect program specific requirements the national program of revitalization of vocational educational institutions which started in aims to attract more students through providing quality teaching that corresponds to labor market requirements within the framework of this program schools are being renovated equipped and staffed as initial vocational education centers these schools cover a wide range of subjects including ict tourism transport agriculture applied art and construction out of the new centers are located in tbilisi and the others in various regions of the country the government is committed to rehabilitate and reestablish more initial vocational training centers however it is expected that private initiatives for developing vocational education will be launched and share of private involvement will increase resulting in the establishment of the network of vet centers responding to specific labor market requirements new vocational training centers will offer training to students with complete basic education and to adults for retraining new skills profession or qualification improvement courses in line with the life long learning principles there is no upper age limit set for initial vocational education as the pre requisite for entering higher academic or vocational education is the completion of general secondary education grades there is a significant risk of blocking upward mobility of those students who enter vocational training centers in order to avoid this risk and in line with modern tendencies of integrating secondary and vocational education it is planned to introduce vocational training courses at the upper secondary level of general education the courses offered by vocational training centers will be incorporated in national curricula another approach designed to prevent this problem is granting the opportunity to young people to complete general secondary education concurrently with vocational courses as external students iv higher education development strategy for the whole education sector and higher education in particular is consistent with the wider national goal of the country to ensure political social and cultural integration into europe therefore joining the bologna process and implementing its guiding principles has been the top priority for the education system of georgia to meet the minimum requirements for joining the bologna process the following major reform directions were identified harmonization of the legislative basis with european standards elimination of corruption introduction of a new model of financing introduction of up to date study programs curricula and syllabi at higher education institutions heis introduction of ects and the three cycle degree system etc new law on higher education provides for entirely new organizational and management structure for higher education institutions makes public universities more autonomous more accountable to the public and democratically governed from the inside governance and management here are based on the principle of election and new legislation defines faculty members students and professors as chief agents in he heads of he institutions are no longer appointed by the president but instead are elected by the members of academic councils the highest representative body of a hei at state universities a third of seats in the representative bodies known as will be reserved for students the recent changes and improvements in he governance should have a positive impact on efficiency transparency and quality of he the funding model of higher education institutions has also changed substantially the input based lump sum financing model of education has been transformed into per capita financing consequently vouchers and grants have been introduced this shift is primarily directed to increasing efficiency and transparency of financing apart from state awarded student grants heis are entitled to receive funding from the following sources i funds received through private grants contributions or a will ii research grants awarded by the state on the basis of competition iii special state budgetary programs designed to encourage the enrolment in those specialties of a higher education institution which represent priority for the state iv program financing allocated by the ministries of a relevant field v any other sources of income allowed by the georgian legislation including revenue from economic activities three cycle degree studies bachelor s master s and doctoral studies have already been introduced in all accredited heis in georgia almost all students below doctoral level are enrolled in the two cycle degree system except for certain specific another effort taken in order to ensure consistency with international he systems was the introduction of ects since one of the accreditation criteria in was whether heis already started introducing ects presently all accredited heis have already met this criteria however additional support in terms of human material and financial assistance is required to make the system operational and effective the moes has assumed the responsibility to reform university curriculum and harmonize teaching contents with bologna process requirements and european he contents another priority area for meeting bologna process principles is the integration of research and he which is currently under way in georgia this is also one of the main priorities within the european neighborhood policy action plan the moes has initiated a competitive system of research funding and has established georgian national scientific foundation to create a competitive model of funding science first national call for applications to receive funding for scientific projects was announced in winners were identified on competitive basis another important change carried out in science management process was the establishment of scientific institutes as legal entities of public law the moes encourages cooperation between research institutions and heis including establishment of scientific academic and institutional links the positive action taken towards integration of the two areas will be the strengthening of research components in graduate programs and doctoral study programs as part of the broader stride towards fighting corruption major efforts were made to improve the transparency of the education system in higher education admission policy was modified and the government successfully introduced the first unified national university entrance examinations the new system of examinations provided by the law on higher education produced first tangible results of increased objectivity transparency and equality in the admission of applicants to higher education institutions the system developed and implemented by the national examination center requires all applicants to pass centralized examinations in order to be admitted in any institution of their choice it is essential to note that the new scheme has also introduced general aptitudes test in georgia for the first time providing opportunity to assess wide range of intellectual skills of students aptitudes test together with georgian language and literature and foreign languages test is compulsory to take for all applicants while selected tests are administered for individual departments in literature mathematics history and social sciences natural sciences unified national examinations have produced some excellent results in fighting corruption present for many years at entrance examinations of higher education institutions both in and the conduct of the examinations was monitored by transparency international in its report on the examinations together with the american councils for international education the testing process was judged to be well organized and transparent wide support for the new system was found throughout the country the survey conducted by transparency international georgia testified that a large majority of test takers parents and administrators felt confident that it would help to eliminate corruption in university admission at national admission examinations students compete for placement at state or private heis determined by the as national accreditation center state grants are awarded to those students who are best achievers at unified national admission examinations this grant can be redeemed as tuition waiver at any state institution or accredited private higher education institution following the examinations administered in instead of percent funding available in the previous year to all scholarship recipients more scholarships were offered on a sliding scale and percent to a greater number of students figure figure distribution of scholarships for higher education of s r nt e e b pi m ci u e n r scholarship source as a result a higher proportion of entrants was entitled to receive some funding from the state compared with the previous year table table applications enrollment and scholarships heis and year of examination applicants enrolled scholarship recipients of applicants who were admitted of the enrolled who received scholarships source the allocation of scholarships is merit based and top scorers at the examinations are entitled to receive it an attempt to address equity concerns was the initiation of a social assistance program by the moes students belonging to certain vulnerable groups who are admitted but do not get enough funding are offered state grants to cover tuition fees within the framework of this program scholarships are annually offered to over students who live in high mountainous regions in conflict zones non georgian secondary schools in the regions densely populated by ethnic minorities the successors of the people who died for territorial integrity of georgia and who were deported from during communist regime are also recipients of this grant in addition over students belonging to the same groups attend annually free preparatory courses for unified national admission exams a student loan system was introduced in georgia in in cooperation with the leading commercial banks of georgia tbc bank bank republic and the bank of georgia students have so far been provided loans with various coverage terms and interest rates further improvement of student loan schemes will be made to increase number and availability of loans as well as lending conditions alongside with policy reform quality issues are of utmost importance the goal is to have a national quality assurance system which will be in line with the standards and guidelines for qa in the european higher education area all heis will have adequate internal quality assurance units external quality assurance will be carried out by the national accreditation center through program accreditation institutional accreditation that is already in place serves as a precondition for program accreditation carrying out program accreditation is now one of the biggest challenges he in georgia is now extensive preparatory works need to be designed and conducted for this purpose including the elaboration of accreditation standards training retraining of experts training qa staff in heis ensure availability of material on qa and accreditation standards and criteria for heis and information on their accreditation status for public v lifelong learning and non formal education the changes introduced into the system of education of georgia ensure the operation of two fundamental principles of contemporary education continuous education and lifelong learning lll each citizen of georgia will have the opportunity to proceed to his her academic or professional career from any level of education provision of education will not be restricted by such factors as previous education age ethnic origin or sex it is crucial that citizens have an opportunity continuously to renew their knowledge skills and competencies however there must be efficient communication and cooperation mechanisms in place between providers at different levels of education it is essential that the citizens of the country have an opportunity to update and upgrade their knowledge and skills on regular basis currently there are no accurate data available for the rate of non formal or adult training and education however it may be assumed that there are not enough opportunities for retraining and qualification improvement for adults to meet new requirements emerging on the labor markets therefore there is the need to develop a coherent and efficient approach for supporting life long and non formal education in the country planning of life long learning in georgia will be consistent with the european neighborhood action plan the tool to carry out european neighborhood policy enp of the european union to which georgia became a party in support to life long learning is one of the priorities of enp development of the national strategy and action plan for lll is currently under way an important part of these activities will be the elaboration of national qualifications framework allowing translation of qualifications across different levels and forms of education not only in the country but abroad as well at the current very initial stage several measures have already been taken to support both adult learning and non formal educational the recently adopted law of georgia on vocational education contains provisions the recognition of qualifications received through non formal education this in its turn will encourage those who are not officially enrolled in educational institutions at any level regularly improve and update their knowledge and skills adult training has been receiving significant consideration and support both from the government as well as from donor agencies specifically several initiatives were launched for the education of minority population a school of public administration established in provides training programs for minority population and trains about public officials annually the program helps not only capacity development among government officials but fosters civic integration of minorities adult training centers are established in the region populated by armenian minority through financial support of european commission and the german government osce office of the high on national minorities supports the operation of language houses in and regions these institutions will proceed with their activities and further measures will be taken to enlarge the adult educational network through the establishment of two more adult training centers vi inclusive education and children with special needs the children with special needs have been receiving considerable attention from policy makers at national level in line with global trends for ensuring equal access of all citizens to education notwithstanding their capacities and background the trend of providing special institutional settings for children with special needs has been shifting towards their and their gradual integration into society in accordance with the national goals of georgia for education and efa goals educational system of the country shall offer each citizen equal opportunity to receive full benefits of education at all levels and shall be adjusted to meet individual needs in georgia the following categories of children are identified as having special educational needs cid children with disabilities and handicap students cid representatives of ethnic minorities cid street children cid children who have the social problems cid children with emotional disorder speech problems and behavior problems cid any student at risk of and exclusion medium term goals of education in georgia include the establishment of appropriate legislative and structural setting for the introduction of inclusive education at all levels however this task should be handled with great care and extensive preparatory measures need be taken with regards of raising public awareness and encouraging acceptance of such children by society as well as developing and introducing relevant standards and methods of teaching at all levels of education for the people with special educational needs building on the experience of the past couple of years particular emphasis will be laid upon and creating alternative forms of care for vulnerable children the previously existing system of special needs children care that would allow for the operation of various types of childcare institutions for orphan children for the children with physical or mental disabilities has undergone transformation country wide efforts have been taken with the purpose of providing alternative forms of care for orphan and abandoned children the process of of orphanages and integration of orphan and abandoned children into society is proceeding at a high pace on february the parliament of georgia approved the main trends of social policy of protection of rights of disabled children based on the above document the government was assigned the task to develop specific implementation strategies for improving child welfare for this purpose an extensive governmental program started in to transform existing childcare system specifically an optimization plan was elaborated aiming at optimization transformation of childcare institutions with an ultimate goal of their significant reduction the following new programs have been introduced and implemented by the moes social services shelters for mothers and infants daycare centers youth centers small family type houses grant program for children deprived of parental care prevention of children abandonment and urgent support for families the table below shows the dynamics of resulting from the implementation of this program dynamics of total prevention adoption total successful performance has been particularly enhanced by the increase in funding allocated from state budget for childcare programs about of total moes budget the second step after should be the integration of children in the mainstream educational process and through it into social life the ministry of education and science of georgia has launched a project for introducing inclusive education for general education institutions for ten schools in tbilisi this project is a pilot initiative which upon successful implementation will serve as a basis for the development of national policy for inclusive education and for introducing similar initiatives throughout the country the strategic approach towards the inclusion of the children with special needs in mainstream education is to prepare all public schools teachers and community at large to accept and facilitate the this therefore it is important that all schools are equipped with appropriate facilities and human resources to meet specific individual needs of children with this purpose various methods of teaching special classes support classes individual programs responding to the special needs or disabilities of children will be designed and introduced throughout the country during the introduction process it is essential to train teachers and improve their capacity to interact with the special needs children and enhance their capacity to appropriately address their further it is important that these children have unrestricted access to special educational material at schools such as audio books visuals toys etc however the idea of inclusive education will not be restricted to schools only and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that there are education opportunities vocational higher academic and professional life long learning adapted to the needs of adult citizens introduction of inclusive education at general schools should be carried out by joint efforts of officials teachers non teachers and most importantly students and parents that is why raising public awareness on the principles and importance of inclusive education is essential although the idea of inclusive education in principle means the inclusion of all disabled children in the general education process it does not consider placing all children with disabilities in general education schools in some cases children will have to be placed in special institutions sometimes as a necessary temporary measure therefore rehabilitation and equipment of existing special educational institutions will be high on agenda particularly so that the introduction of inclusive education is in its very initial phase there is the need to rehabilitate infrastructure readjust teaching methods and curricula in accordance with latest standards and best international practices and update learning material train retrain teachers in such institutions in accordance with updated standards to facilitate access free transportation will be available for the children to special schools action plan for the education sector a current and medium term public expenditure on education

increase further however due to the projected rapid growth of gdp over the next five years the share of expenditure on education will not change significantly consolidated public expenditure consists

of the extra funding is available allowing plan targets to be fully achieved table shows the current resource scenario for early childhood development and pre primary education an per cent increase in public expenditure at this level between and combined with an increase in the student teacher ratio allows a per cent rise in non personnel current expenditure which will help to finance some of the

increase at the same rate as in table shows the current resource scenario for general education a per cent increase in public expenditure at this level between and combined with an increase in the student teacher ratio allows a huge increase in non personnel current expenditure this would help to finance some of the quality increasing components of the plan and there should be some resources left over to fund another crucial prerequisite of improvement in the quality of general education a further increase in teachers salaries towards an adequate and competitive level it should be noted

education for all this section of the plan provides a brief description of the priority areas identified within the plan which are considered as the most important for achieving the efa goals these are also the areas which are not covered either by the governmental commitments in or by in country donors priority area early childhood development and pre school education pre school education as described above unlike other levels of education is the domain where legislative and structural foundations have not yet been laid absence of unified national policy on pre school education and lack of a clear distribution of commitments and responsibilities among different levels of government makes it difficult as yet to plan specific activities in this field however there is agreement that this is a priority area for improving the readiness of young children for school and life long learning as well as developing basic social and life skills at an age when it is most appropriate to intervene currently a number of activities have been identified which are to be carried out in order to improve the readiness of pre school age children for primary school and provide opportunities for quality pre school education to those children who currently do not enjoy them component develop initial teacher education and in service training programs for pre school teachers and curriculum teachers are an important source of information for children enrolled in pre school education and key players in developing essential skills and capacities no major transformation of the pre school teaching concept has been introduced since soviet times therefore the methods and ways children are taught at pre schools are outdated and not up to modern development standards therefore pre service as well as in service training programs will be organized for teachers including professional higher education programs at heis or community colleges ba programs for primary and pre school teachers translating and publishing relevant resources for teachers will be part of this component together with teacher training programs curricula will be elaborated for pre school education taking into account age specific requirements and development standards that are to be achieved in order to ensure appropriate readiness of a child for primary education children s books will be designed specifically for pre school age since most of the books that are used at pre schools are outdated and not responding to contemporary needs and standards component design diversified forms of providing pre school education although it is difficult to make an accurate assessment of enrollment rates in pre school education in georgia and distribution by geographical location as well as by the size of income it order of priorities is arbitrary and it does not reflect the order or preference is apparent that enrollment is low and major disparities are observed between rural and urban as well as between high income and low income families urban rural differences are explained by the difficulty in physical access to pre school facilities while in the second case inability to pay fees for pre school services plays the key role designing diversified forms of providing pre school education and introducing promoting them through the cooperation of local municipalities will be helpful to support increased access such alternative forms will include daycare centers pre school classes in general schools sunday schools parent education component produce and distribute educational material and resources for pre school age children a school readiness study carried out by unicef in demonstrated that in the per cent of homes with children aged to there were no children s books and paper and drawing material necessary to develop the critical skills of holding pencils and crayons and drawing were present in only per cent of the observed households as already discussed children who attend pre schools tend to come from more prosperous and educated families therefore the ones who stay at home are more likely to be the disadvantaged educational materials and resource packages will be produced and distributed to the neediest per cent of the year old population immediately prior to entering schools component subsidize educational component of pre school care for the needy children pilot initiative as mentioned in the previous sections children enrolled in pre schools are disproportionately from prosperous families one approach to solving this problem and enrolling more needy children in pre school education is the introduction of partial of the educational component of early childhood care for year old children from poor families this will be done through the introduction of flexible schedules at pre schools and through diversified programs referred to above only those pre schools or care centers which take in needy children will be given the amount needed to cover educational costs per child teacher remuneration teaching material etc as there is no legislative and structural basis yet in place for ecd this will be a pilot initiative which upon successful performance actual increase in enrollment and improvement in school readiness will be taken over as a committed responsibility by the moes costs design alternative pre school education programs and subsidize the educational component for the most needy children for one year through the diversified forms of education gel teacher in service training programs in service and pre service gel initial teacher education programs and curriculum development gel development of learning material and distribution to the children from needy families gel total gel priority area support to ongoing school consolidation process through the provision of school buses in remote areas rationale geographical characteristics of georgia should be taken into account in ensuring free and unrestricted access of all to education school students particularly in rural and high mountainous areas often experience problems in getting to schools located at large distances from their residences this problem became more apparent following the large scale school optimization process the process which started in and is implemented in two major phases is aimed at reducing the number of small schools through their merger and consolidation as a result the number of public schools was effectively reduced from over to current the second phase of optimization will be over before the start of academic year reduction in the number of schools generated a problem of access which was addressed by the presidential program for rehabilitation through the provision of school buses for transportation of children from remote areas public schools are served now by school buses were purchased from the budget and more were donated however the demand for school buses is greater currently public schools have applied to the moes with requests to provide free transportation for students including requests for the provision of specialized buses currently no amount is allocated in the budget for covering these expenses while the necessity to do it is apparent activities the problems with physical access to general schools can be solved through the purchase of school buses for the areas where this problem exists together with the purchase of school buses it is essential to publish two user manuals one for drivers and another for parents and children to ensure safe maintenance and usage of buses sustainability the current project approach of funding capital expenditures for educational institutions will shift to the approach based entirely on per capita funding i e the costs that are currently covered under various programs will be incurred by schools from the per capita funding amount allocated for them however the government of georgia is committed to not withdrawing the funds from the moes budget after the completion of these programs therefore this amount can then be channeled to increase per capita funding and to ensure that schools have enough resources and capacity to use buses properly as well as to cover maintenance and depreciation costs costing number of buses unit price gel total for buses gel costs for manual preparation and publishing gel total gel priority area provision of textbooks to students in need through the design and implementation of a textbook rental scheme rationale notwithstanding the latest positive social and economic developments in the country and the upward trend of economic growth the share of population living in poverty is still quite large creating a viable and efficient social security system is an essential pre requisite for the country s development reducing poverty to minimum and improving social conditions in general is one of the most important priorities for georgia currently the government of georgia has introduced a unified social assistance policy to ensure efficient allocation of resources for the most needy in line with this policy there are efforts to be taken in educational domain as well to provide equal opportunities of learning for all citizens of the country due to the hard financial conditions of households mentioned above many parents are unable to purchase books for their children operation of secondary book markets and used book donating practices help solve this problem however those students who are exposed to new national curricula do not have access to used books as new textbooks are designed along with curricula currently there are no textbook rental schemes in place hence the chances are big that those students from vulnerable families who are studying according to new curricula will have no access to textbooks activities to solve this problem a low cost textbook rental scheme will be introduced for primary school students from poor families sustainability the textbooks will be distributed through schools to needy students at a low price upon the use students shall return books to schools schools will be responsible for ensuring sustainability of the system through compensating depreciation costs costing number of students covered cost of the activity gel priority area building capacity of autonomous school administrators rationale one of the most significant outcomes of the reform program in general education is the quick and total decentralization of the system establishment of schools as and granting full autonomy to them in administration and governance observations of the school management reveal that schools lack the capacity to perform financial management in a professional manner thus intensive training consultancy services will be introduced and implemented on a regular basis school training needs will be assessed by needs assessment studies conducted on annual basis improvement in the capacity of school administrators and principals in financial general management as well as in monitoring and evaluation will be one of the top priorities this capacity will then be institutionalized in schools and the knowledge gained in the training sessions will be transferred to the school level activities two representatives from each public school will be provided intensive training sessions in accounting expenditure reporting and using relevant ict the ultimate goal is to ensure that information provided by school officials is accurate reliable and well communicated to all levels of education management sustainability a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation strategy will be designed to monitor and evaluate the outcome of training conducted for school administrators the application of the training in practice and dissemination of the information at school level will be of high priority for the school administrators this way the sustainability of the training programs will be assured costing number of schools total costs for software installation and training per school gel total estimated costs gel priority area supporting initial teacher education and in service teacher training for primary education component designing initial teacher education ite courses for primary school teachers rationale teacher qualifications play a key role in ensuring high quality of education upcoming teacher examination and certification process will serve as an incentive for acting teachers to improve their qualifications in accordance with contemporary standards several in service teacher training initiatives have already taken place teachers in schools were trained within the education system reform and realignment program however it is crucial to pay particular attention to ite which is largely underdeveloped currently in georgia activities primary school teachers according to the law of georgia on general education should possess minimum ba degree to be able to teach an effort to improve teacher qualifications through ite will include the following designing a ba program credits for primary school teachers introduction of the program in georgian universities tbilisi as well as at universities in regions translation and publication of material for students component conducting trainings for foreign language teachers rationale in the light of current developments and the growing international context for education retraining foreign language teachers is an issue of prime importance this is particularly true of rural areas in regions teachers lack essential skills and capacities needed for training in foreign languages which is then reflected upon poor performance of students therefore tit is essential that the capacity be strengthened in the most low performing schools in foreign languages activities designing and conducting brief training sessions for foreign language teachers at schools with the weakest language teaching capacities sessions will be provided for foreign language teachers who teach in primary classes trainings will focus on teaching methods and techniques training material will be provided for the trained teachers upon completion component designing and introducing special ite programs for primary school teachers in minority regions and introducing teacher incentive mechanisms rationale the regions densely populated by national minorities and inhabited by armenians and azeri respectively are the ones potentially most threatened by the lack of qualified and motivated teaching staff surveys carried out in these regions have demonstrated the low level of preparation of teachers teaching georgian as a state language is the most significant challenge in these regions since insufficient language skills prevent the residents of these regions from entering heis and later finding suitable opportunities on the labor market attracting young qualified professionals through well designed ite programs and appropriate incentive schemes will help the regions develop their human potential activities special ite programs for primary education in minority regions will be developed along with incentives for attracting skilled staff to minority schools in particular primary school teachers professional development in minority regions will include designing special ba programs for primary school teachers from minority regions introduction of appropriate incentive schemes to encourage young people to apply to these programs e g scholarships for students designing bilingual training model for primary education its incorporation into ite component introduction of incentive system for applicants to ite programs committed to work in high mountainous and minority regions rationale qualifications and skills of teachers are the factors that are crucial in ensuring the quality of education high mountainous regions and regions populated by ethnic minorities are the ones most threatened by the absence of qualified and motivated teaching staff therefore it is important to introduce an efficient incentive scheme for encouraging young people to apply to ite programs and upon graduation work in those regions activities offer full scholarships covering tuition fees and living costs for the students who apply to ite programs for primary school teachers in exchange for their commitment to work in high mountainous and minority regions costs design of ite program for primary teachers including preparation translation and publication of and training material gel training foreign language teachers gel design of ite program for primary teachers in minority regions teachers including preparation translation and publication of and training material design of bilingual model for primary education gel incentive schemes for teachers from minority and high mountainous regions gel total gel priority area improving access to general education and quality of learning for the children with special needs component preparing all general schools of georgia for educating the children with special needs rationale in accordance with efa goals the state will ensure giving equal opportunities to all for inclusion in education notwithstanding their abilities currently majority of the children with special needs are either located in special institutions those with physical or mental disabilities or their special needs are not addressed properly those with emotional and psychological disorders following the introduction of inclusive education within the pilot project in model schools in capital all the schools in the country must be ready to educate the children with special needs activities in order to be able to respond to individual learning needs of all the children general schools should be equipped with appropriate learning material as well as teaching staff who are aware of and applying the principles of inclusive education in practice therefore the following are the activities aimed at improving schools readiness for providing quality education for those who are vulnerable for marginalization and exclusion providing intensive training teachers form all public schools monitoring further dissemination of the knowledge and capacities gained at the training preparation of learning materials audio books special software visual material toys etc for each public school component improving access and quality of learning at special schools rationale while recognizing the need to integrate children with special needs into mainstream educational processes in the country it is nevertheless important to realize that in certain cases children will be placed in specialized schools in order to meet their individual demands therefore in the medium term there is an essential need to rehabilitate and improve learning environment as well as access in the existing special needs schools which will be retained activities currently there are schools for the children with special needs out of them are located in the capital and in the regions activities needed to improve learning environment for these schools will include physical infrastructure rehabilitation of the schools retraining teachers additionally specialized schools buses will be purchased to enhance access
