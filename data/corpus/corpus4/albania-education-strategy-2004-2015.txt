current version of the strategy owes a great deal and relies heavily on the document national pre university education development strategy already formally approved by the albanian government in june the major changes of this strategy if compared with the previous document consist largely in a new chapter on vocational education has been inserted and elaborated upon there is a special part in it devoted considerably to the private education service those sentences making any close or deliberate reference to any particular government or any viewpoints expressly stated by it have been crossed out the national strategy on pre university education is a fruit that has been arrived at by the considerable efforts spanning several years being made by both the albanian specialists and their foreign counterparts it is the common ground of work for our teachers and managers with high stakes in education thus we show our deep and heartfelt appreciation of their engagement in this deep endeavor a deep gratitude is extended to the highly prestigious international institutions in particular to the world bank for the irreplaceable assistance they have rendered to development of this strategy their efforts are underway also in its implementation stages this strategy for the most part is elevated to a national platform within which all of the stakeholders are invited to share in their invaluable contributions it crowns one of the more serious attempts being made at engaging an intensely vocational audience at establishing an all inclusive dialogue and nurturing good understanding and faith among the various actors the strategy is intended to guarantee a modern national education system which will have to promote and instigate the sustainable growth of economy and consolidation of democracy as well as the success of dialogue and competition with the countries of the region and beyond this document has been maintained together after plenty of broad and intensive consultation process with the various stakeholders such as teachers education mangers parents pupils ngos teachers unions and high brow people etc the draft nes is structured into two major parts part a identifies the priority areas that need to be addressed for the development of pre university education in albania for these areas it outlines the strengths and weaknesses within the moes and indicates possible actions designed to enhance the strengths and eliminate the weaknesses these discussions are guided by international best principles and practices in education development as exemplified in organization for economic co operation and development oecd and eu countries there are four key or priority issues identified in part a focusing on the governance and managing of education improving the quality of teaching and learning financing education and developing the capacity to implement the nes part b the key or priority issues in part a by specifying for each issue the objectives and their associated beneficiaries monitoring indicators risks and assumptions and general timelines in the form of policy matrices this information is extracted from the narrative descriptions of the respective priority areas in part a and hence is summarized as four separate matrices part c maps out the implementation plan and provides timelines and sequence of activities noted in sections a and b the information is structured along the priority areas and each area has been dealt with separately part d presents a summary of cost estimates for implementing the national education strategy the estimates are based on units costs aggregated from a range of sources such as the moes the world bank education sector project and ngo s part e present the resource input matrix and the assumptions used to map and calculate the estimate costs the national strategy of education is a document at the macro level and as such it does not taken upon itself to treat any details at the micro level of all the activities and procedures related to it in the process of implementing such a strategy a set of complementing projects will be drafted part a priority development issues for pre university education a governance reforming and strengthening management capacity the implementation of a highly centralized management model in the governance of the country in general and in the sector of general services brings about the decrease of the effectiveness and efficiency of the public administration while the formal restructuring that is decentralization as such has made considerable progress in several sectors including the education sector the decentralization rate of responsibilities and of the decision making authority at the central level down to the local one in this sector have not been satisfactory particularly in the case of pre university education a reforming the central office while a restructuring of the central office has been done thanks to the assistance of the world bank it s worth noting that several steps have been taken in establishing and organizing the second level regional educational departments red and educational offices eo yet the subsequent challenge rising up is concerned with the functioning of a performance based management pbm system at all levels of the educational governance this together with greater clarity of job roles will define individuals task and associated levels of performance included in the performance management reform will be procedures to ensure the maintenance of a minimum level of performance and also appeals provisions to ensure equity and fairness transparency will also be increased by the system having multiple points for reporting and auditing enhancing in so doing the transparency and its activities in the short term the central office will be operating on a pbm model of management with clearly defined roles and responsibilities this initiative will then flow through to the regional offices affiliate institutes and centers and communes and schools the pbm model will be used to encourage greater individual responsibility for self development and innovation a decentralization decentralization in the education sector will ensure the expansion of participation and the increase of effectiveness of the stakeholders in holding on to the education projects and their subsequent successful implementation at present a detailed project on decentralization is held to be a significant support to the tremendous success of its implementation according to it moes in consultation with the other line ministries and support from international agencies will devolve authority responsibility and accountability for education governance to regional offices communes and schools the implementation platform is designed to achieve sharing of functional responsibilities in the education sector by means of the governmental levels identifying the right and proper conditions to increase responsibility on the functions to decentralized from the central level down to the school level this process will be made possible through a careful and meticulous balance to be struck between centralization and decentralization in itself to be accompanied by awareness on the risks and the chances of success a school autonomy under the decentralized system schools are required to take increased responsibility for planning and managing the development of the services they deliver along with the associated quality improvement procedures the current organizational system and personnel have limited capacity to do this as up to this point parents and local communities have had little input into the activities of the schools and hence do not claim ownership of the development and maintenance of the quality of services provided by the schools the successful realization of the school autonomy involves changes to be made to some parts of the legislation this will involve changing legislation to allow new practices and procedures to be implemented and supported as the current legislation does not encourage the participation of parents or school directors to take initiative to be innovative and improve conditions in their schools the grant scheme destined for schools as the key ingredient of school autonomy will favor building capacities at the school and regional levels to engage in budget planning etc this capacity will be developed progressively moving across three levels it is acknowledged that the progress will vary and this continuous support will be provided during the next ten years support will also be harnessed through forming clusters of small schools that will share successful strategies in the move toward autonomy these schools will pilot their new experiences so that they may serve as a model for the decentralization of education a educational management information system having inadequate data is a major obstacle hindering the development of well informed policies and procedures which are designed to improve the quality and efficiency of the education system with assistance from the wb the department has been established to act as the key moes unit for data analysis and policy making this unit needs to work in conjunction with to plan the types of data that should be collected and levels at which collection should take place the wb project has also supported the development of an educational management information system emis to assist the in the achievement of these tasks emis is not just about getting data onto a computer rather it provides the tool for conceptual research and the analytical investigation of the collected data the system should empower people at different levels in the system with the capacity to economic infrastructure social including minority groups and educational data in terms of rural urban and central regional district municipal and school levels the unit responsible for collecting and processing information should be made robust in order to boos its own activities in several directions the information to be collected should represent a unique system of data with regard to the nomenclature and the extent of processing as such the nomenclature of data to be collected should be a responsibility resting with moes and should receive the blessing or consent of the highest levels reliability and the completion of such an information should be fully confirmed through the institutional cooperation to be established and retained with the information collected should be considered to be an institutional property to be placed at the service of the system a reporting and quality assurance quality assurance of the services requires a fundamental philosophical shift which is not only concerned with policy making as such but also with the monitoring qa should have both internal and external elements internal qa can be used by both individuals and organizational units it provides immediate feedback and formative evaluation outcomes and is a powerful tool which needs to be utilized more to complement the self audit there has to be periodic external monitoring external qa which will provide a national and international comparisons of the quality of performance of education planners administrators etc the dual system of internal and external qa mechanisms will need to be built into the management system and will need to have multiple pathways for reporting and auditing to increase transparency the dual monitoring of school performance creates the possibility of not only undertaking effective improvement actions in the form of assistance from specialized local and national units but also bringing to account those responsible if a school fails to achieve its standards and student achievement objectives which are specified and defined in the school s development plans the whole school management support team is responsible and for example the local government could limit the functions delegated to the school and disband the school board currently the is being reformed to operate at two levels central and local for the pre university education system a improving the quality of the teaching and learning process right after the changes affecting the political economic system the governmental initiatives have been directed towards a market driven economy and democratic and civil society as well as the installation of the market economy the national strategy for socio economic development the long term and short term objectives focusing on boosting the sustainable economic growth reducing poverty and other social related problems the fulfillment of such lofty goals requires at all costs the reforming of the education system which could be turned into a back up system to carry forwards the initiatives laid down central to the reform is the quality of the teaching and learning processes the current teaching and learning processes and the pre university education curriculum were last reviewed in since then there have been very little if any changes made to increase the average level of education completed by its citizens the government of albania is implementing a new structure for pre university education a three level primary basic secondary grade structure free and compulsory education will occur up to grade previously it was up to grade adopting this structure will bring the albanian education system in line with other countries in the balkan region as well as those in the eu and oecd the early levels will concentrate on basic literacy and numeracy along with civic education and healthy living skills providing the basis for developing the knowledge and skills for a democratic society and a knowledge society the secondary level will build on the basic level education and develop the knowledge and skills necessary for everyday life in a market driven and democratic world it will have two pathways one that leads directly into academic professions and one that will allow students to develop vocational skills necessary to become productive members of the society when they leave secondary school a curriculum development national curriculum framework the moes began working on curricula reform in while there has been some work done in this regard there is still a considerable amount of and curriculum development work yet to be accomplished in areas such as developing and adopting a national curriculum framework and national policies the dependent structures such as the ics and which are funded and having as a reference any goals written up and defined by moes are considered to be the cogs of a single wheel in improving quality of the educational services under the circumstances moes aside from monitoring and closely evaluating the work done should see to the development of the accountability in the organizational units of the policies for reporting and monitoring and of the quality of curriculum development output indicators etc finally there is an urgent need to make curriculum development a full time and ongoing profession to ensure the adoption of continuous improvement principles in the education development and management process rationalization of subjects there is a need to develop a curriculum that focuses on the know ledge skills and attributes needed by children to function in a free market economy and a democratic society this requires a shift from the current collection of isolated subjects to an approach that is focused on key learning outcomes the curriculum experts need to explore new subject options and or the integration of subjects to meet the demand for the new knowledge and skills content articulation vertical and horizontal integration one of the reasons for the high student drop out rate has been the lack of interest in pre university education in light of this there is a need to align the current curriculum content and processes with the emerging needs and aspirations of students and parents authentic and integrated learning activities that reflect everyday life experience should be included integrating subjects for example will not only facilitate the possibility of making the learning more relevant but also reduce the number of separate textbooks that may be necessary addressing one of the major costs impacting on pre university education the current student workload is high compared to oecd guidelines and benchmarks the curriculum reform should consider the quality of learning rather than the quantity allowing more time for student to experiment research reflect and synthesize information structure of the pre university education curriculum changing the structure of the pre university system into years of basic education year of lower secondary education and years of upper the living standards measurement survey secondary education dictates reviewing the curricula frame in order to provide responses to issues that arise with our time and age and to bring it closer and closer to the systems of countries in the regions and in the countries of eu within this structure the curriculum needs to reflect a clear vertical integration of concepts and eventual articulation with university programs the use of electives needs to be care fully planned to provide the gradual development of student choice and inclusive curriculum the rapid inner developments and the ever growing demand to join the european community bring to the fore the ever urgent need to increase the flexibility in drafting and designing the curriculum so that schools and local authorities can customize the curriculum to make it relevant to local circumstances or long running tradition appropriate policies guiding the use of electives and subject clusters can provide that flexibility in these areas of student choice and inclusion while the curriculum framework and national standards are set centrally by the moes the school boards and local governments need the flexibility for example to approve the school curriculum policy and prioritize specific curriculum projects in school grant applications non public education the permission granted in favor of opening up private owned schools in heralded a steady rise in their number and an expansion of their services at such a moderate pace that with the year in mind the private sector to date by and large encompasses of children at the pre school education level of pupils at the pre university education in basic education in the general secondary education and in the vocational secondary education and of students at the same time it s worth noting that several education services such as the publication printing and dissemination distribution of school textbooks as well as construction rehabilitation and maintenance of school buildings or facilities have already undergone the privatization process the attendance of such schools by a substantial number of pupils does not necessarily happen because of any offer at all in terms of subjects contained within the curriculum package since any changes that set them apart from the public schools are largely confined to the inclusion of the informatics subject or the learning of a foreign language at an earlier stage as well as the learning of another additional or complementary language the attendance of such schools is deemed to be more as a counterbalance against the low quality level prevailing at state owned schools this reality tips the balance in favor of private schools owing to the small number of pupils per class better and reference resources and rich equipments in laboratories and better qualified teaching personnel carefully selected and recruited by such schools nonetheless there is not as yet any official comparative study to date that brings out any differences in terms of students achievements in the private and public schools however quality level in such schools is highly likely to be compromised by the guiding business principles the tendency is for business interests to upon quality hence of quality in education services will set in the tight concentration of private schools in some of the big towns as already witnessed by all and sundry has limited to varying degrees the access of pupils coming from rural areas to their education on the other hand the extraordinarily hefty prices they charge has transformed them into education centers to be attended only by the privileged elite mainly the well off and the wealthy interestingly the education service is deemed to be the means of increasing the scope of educational offer towards the wide range of interests and various needs of many educational customers for this significant reason alone the private education service ought to be encouraged and promoted by means of increasing the size and number of private schools at all levels across the education system adding more to their kind and range expanding the various kinds of other educational services another significant reason behind the expansion of the private education service is closely tied to the financial considerations despite the necessary increase of the share of gdp in the education sector and the need for a far more aggressive drive towards drawing in foreign funds other alternative sources of funding are badly needed in order to realize the so called leap in quality and in the achievements of pupils on this and other accounts it s of the essence to align business interests with the education market drives and tendencies encouraging policies towards private education institutions are to be further considered and developed through a set of mechanisms such as easing fiscal policies and or the government being committed to covering the better part of the recurrent operational expenditures these mechanisms are to be closely pursued especially in the vocational and post secondary education in order for them to be a close fit for the labor market needs in the case of higher education in order to take off the pressure of the state budget for the over expenditures in this sector in order to make sure that there appears and exists a fair number of offers as well for the schools of children of special needs favors of the ad hoc type could be basically done in accordance with the pressing needs such as providing for access to basic or general secondary education in the less favorable or disadvantaged areas in order to maintain a normal rate of operation in the areas that are singled out for their over crowded schools expanding the private educational service market beyond the private schooling for the training and counseling administered to the benefit of teachers and education managers alike monitoring and assessing the various aspects of the education services for the assistance rendered to the benefit of pupils with special needs etc combined with a close supervision of the quality of such services and in ensuring the adequate competition as a prerequisite to boosting the quality of such services the quality as such much claimed and sought out by the wide range of private education customers will be through the systematic and periodic inspection and the full transparency around the achievements of pupils at these schools any risks posed by the unfair competition between the private and public schools at the expense of the services provided by the latter could be best avoided or be kept at a minimum through the management and performance based teaching learning process and the high degree of the transparency in such achievements towards the refined public and professional opinion a teacher development better forecasting of teacher demand the up to now period of the albanian ongoing transition has been characterized from a marked and deep lack focused and systematic investment in the training of teachers pre service training has been always provided by universities but in service training since independence has been conducted in an uncoordinated manner various agencies both domestic and overseas ones have conducted some sporadic teacher training mainly for teachers in primary grades this lack of a coherent approach has resulted in poor quality teachers and an increasing number of untrained teachers teaching in schools the lack of a thorough and a coherent method has reduced significantly the effectiveness of such trainings strengthening the teacher development centre with the assistance of the world bank the establishment of the education center of training and qualifications was made a reality among other things its establishment was triggered and by the lack of teachers standards qualifications training modules performance appraisal etc part of the national education strategy is to develop clear guidelines for the roles and responsibilities of the center s staff in relation to the central and regional stakeholders teacher training curriculum content and processes to develop a sound basis for teacher education there is an urgent need to develop a detailed list of teacher competencies for primary basic and secondary education teachers these competencies need to be mapped onto pre service programs which in turn should be guided by the bologna conventions further professional practice needs to be integrated into the new programs conditions of employment and merit based incentive schemes to attract and retain high quality teachers the in close cooperation with moes should research new incentive schemes that are based on performance and merit rather than being based simply on length of service some urgent action is needed to bring some respectability to the profession by matching its salaries with other civil servants considering new models and alternatives to teacher training apart from the basic training scheme the should consider alternative models for ensuring teacher training such as models for training teachers in mixed ability collective classrooms the model of training teachers for certain classrooms the hybrid model the frontal and distance learning quality assurance and teacher registration there arises the need to develop the process of teacher registration and accreditation as well as the implementation of the procedures for ongoing monitoring process teacher registration should be a prerequisite for employment as a teacher the centre should develop initial and ongoing monitoring processes for teacher accreditation and registration these processes should cover the application approval and dispute resolution areas and need to be formally drafted and adopted by the moes the development of these processes should be done in conjunction with the reform of teacher training programs to ensure that the competencies expected as part of the registration process are included in the training programs in service training this is perhaps one of the most critical issues confronting the moes due to the urgent need to train the large number of currently untrained teachers and to upgrade the skills of others with regard to developing competencies in new and innovative teaching methods the ongoing professional development of teachers needs to be strategically aligned with their needs such training needs to focus on aspects such as the new attributes and subject knowledge that teachers need along with exposure to the new teaching and learning models to ensure quality and efficiency alternative modes of delivering in service training need to be considered for example the training could involve the use of intensive block training distance learning or a hybrid of these modes further in service training does not need to be restricted to universities with bodies such as non government organizations ngos international agencies and teacher professional associations becoming involved in service professional development activities should be credited towards formal qualifications or meeting the requirements for ongoing teacher registration a textbook development textbooks are central to the teaching learning process currently as a way of compensating for their limited teaching competencies teachers tend to use the textbooks as props covering the content of the textbooks rather than using the content to address the objectives of the curriculum this process reflects the teachers limited understanding of the objectives inherent in the curriculum the role of textbooks needs to be looked at in particular with regard to their design and development better selection of content and instructional design issues as indicated above the role of textbooks in the teaching learning process is central and a crucial aspect of this is the content and instructional design of the books there is need to revise and align the textbook development process with the qa models used by eu countries for developing and maintaining their education quality the current approach of having textbooks written by university professors may not be the best tactic as occurs in many developed countries classroom teachers should be encouraged to get involved in the design and development of textbooks the new generation of textbooks should promote the adoption of teaching and learning approaches which are based on real life situations and are student centered and activity driven they should also encourage group work as well as independent creative and critical thinking to address this there is a need to train potential authors in instructional design principles and their underlying pedagogical assumptions coordinating the demand and supply of textbooks there is a need for a planned and coordinated approach to textbook development particularly as the pre university curriculum is revised the new curriculum will most likely have a different mix of subjects and associated content which will determine the number and range of textbooks many of which may have to be new the emis database will assist in planning the demand and supply of different titles currently using the supply as opposed to the demand model extra books are being printed unnecessarily for certain subjects managing the demand and supply of alternative textbooks with a student centered learning approach alternative texts are important the selection of alternative books should involve all stakeholders such as parents teachers professional subject associations and local government and they in turn may apply pressure on authors and the publishing houses for an increase in variety and quality with the decentralization of schools people who are in closest contact with subjects are the teachers and they should be responsible for the management and monitoring of the demand and supply of textbooks privatization with the various levels and the whole mix of schools in mind the development and distribution of school textbooks should be devolved to the private sector while the moes should still have the responsibility for qa processes and the recommendation of specific class textbooks the process of selection of class textbooks should be a transparent one done on a competitive basis the moes has begun some work in this regard and intends to gradually privatize the entire textbook development activity the moes will approve the production quality instructional design and suitability of content for the various grades and in that role will be a qa agent rather than a publishing house cost recovery currently students in pre university education are fortunate to have textbooks provided free of charge however as this imposes huge costs on the education sector which are not sustainable in the long term there is a need to explore alternative means of financing textbook development and use the moes with support from international agencies will consider various options this is critical because as new teaching and learning approaches are introduced a larger variety of learning resources will be needed and they will need to be funded a alternative teaching resources the current key resource for pre university education is the class text books with teachers teaching only the content of textbook with little or no consideration of alternative resources including the use of icts which is very limited in the pre university education program to redress these deficits there is a need to gradually introduce additional textbooks and other reference books by starting classroom libraries and in larger schools where it is possible to establish proper libraries with internet facilities the newly created centre for teacher development ctd and the institute for curriculum and standards ics should be researching ways to develop and support additional resources for pre university education one option for them is to work with and support teachers in the development of examples of good practices which can then be shared nationally with other teachers they should also be constantly engaged in researching new and innovative practices teaching and learning resources for different subjects and developing cd roms and or hard copies of materials for distribution to schools which enjoy no access to internet while the roles of ctd and ics have been clearly defined it would be necessary for them to start thinking about their new functions to match the new forms which should be on the look out for new practices and the new teaching learning sources a examinations and monitoring within the overall framework of the education reform two important basic institutional reforms were the establishment of the national centre for evaluation and assessment ncea as well as the within the moes with regard to the ncea this organizational restructuring needs to be complemented with the development of the human capacity to increase the monitoring and evaluating capabilities of the ncea to international standards further there is a need to develop an external qa system see a to monitor the performance of the ncea and to increase its efficiency strengthening capacity the current capacity in ncea seems to be largely in the area of statistical knowledge this needs to be expanded to include education experts who can develop rigorous indicators of students learning outcomes the centre also needs some new equipment to carry out its work efficiently and to undertake national and international benchmarking of the learning process monitoring quality and international benchmarking since the government wants to develop the country to the point that will enable them to move into the eu and engage with other neighboring countries there is an urgent need to develop national and international benchmarking and monitoring systems the newly formed ncea has been given some training under the current wb education project but there is still significant capacity building yet to be achieved for example the development of an equitable grading and ranking system to moderate the results from around different regions in the republic is yet to be considered developing and managing national examinations the public confidence in the current examination system is very low and the ncea has been assigned the task of bringing integrity and public confidence to the system it has to develop a transparent but secure system free from unauthorized disclosure of examination information the process of conducting and grading examinations should also be reviewed to remove the possibility of cheating or undue influence for example teachers should not be allowed to supervise their own students and students examination papers should be randomly coded rather than have recognized labels all conflicts of interest or possible compromising situations need to be eliminated from the examination management system the ncea should research and consult with all stakeholders to develop a single examination at the end of grade this examination should serve not only as an indicator of the knowledge achieved by grade students but also as a measure for university entry the proposed subject clusters approach in the secondary curriculum will allow articulation into university programs and consequently the level of achievement in the matura examination can be used by universities to decide their preferred entry cut offs a financing pre university education since public expenditure on education as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp has been gradually decreasing from in and in to in and to in this expenditure is lower than the average in neighboring countries the percentage expenditure of the public budget for education compared to total public expenditure for year is only this indicator compared to in and in does not witness any growth at all the changing economic and socio cultural aspirations within the country have imposed significant demands on the current education system and if it is not appropriately funded there is a risk of further deterioration of services in the sector particularly the pre university sub sector this could bring such services at a standstill if measures are not appropriately launched since the late nineties the demand for capital expenditure has increased significantly due to the damage of school premises during the transition period and the crisis and the lack of appropriate ongoing maintenance moes should exploring alternative means of funding this demand from national sources a instruments and processes for transfer of funds block grants whatever the process the system does not appear to be responsive to the changing needs as exemplified by the maintenance issue above there are other examples first the increased categories of activities in the pre university sub sector and distribution of resources among those categories have changed but the total expenditure in education has not confirming that the system is not responsive to the rapidly changing conditions in this sub sector and second the increase in internal and external migration and the flexibility for students to attend schools in neighboring regions may pose problems in the area of cross regional funding to overcome these and similar problems and to be responsive to the changing demands and allow flexibility and equity for students and regions a per capita funding model that links directly to schools may be an alternative rather than using pre determined amounts this model is based on actual student numbers which can act as an indicator of the size of the school the extent of facilities the number of teacher and support staff that are needed and not necessarily in the amount of money predetermined by way of pragmatic and archaic methods as has been the case up to the present day local government funding under the current system all maintenance of schools is the responsibility of local government and this is funded from the grant transferred from the national budget and or through local governments contribution generated through local tax etc it is unclear how much funds are generated locally and how much is actually spent on maintenance of school building and facilities as the actual percentage of funds made available by local governments for the education sector generally and for the sub sectors specifically is not available to the moes s central finance directorate also the moes does not have any information about the accountability of the disbursement of local government funds this lack of information seriously undermines moes s financial planning and its ability to provide an equitable funding model recurrent expenditure managed by the central office of the moes the central office of the moes manages the disbursement of all other recurrent expenditure such as those related to the publication of the textbooks scholarships didactic materials and transport for teachers and students in light of potential cost benefits due to economies of scale maintaining some of these services at the central level have advantages but some of the activities such as transport and scholar ships would be better under the control of the local governments and communes some of this re alignment to increase efficiency and cost savings may happen through the decentralization process irrespective of the division of responsibility detailed budget planning is necessary to increase the accountability of both the local governments and the central office and both should be able to the costs for each variable if necessary accountability and transparency the accountability of all funds transferred from the moes central office to the local governments and those contributed by local governments should be made more transparent the inclusion of budget line items for all major activities through the central and local regional funding is going to clear up some of the confusion hovering around moes has identified at least seven programs which do not figure in at the level of the local government the presence of such line items will ensure the realization of as planned and in compliance with the timelines but more significantly the proposed practices would help the financial planners to better identify the pitfalls and actual expenditures at the various levels of the system budget planning capacity the current supply model of the education services is reflected in the financing system one of the key reform assumptions is to shift to a demand and performance based model for managing and financing the sub sector for this to happen there is a need to develop capacities at the various levels in the financial system to engage in not only developing detailed budget plans but also implementing and managing the plan a increasing efficiency in the sub sector funding communication and information sharing the local government s contribution to the education sector generally should be made available to the moes to assist in the planning of its budget this financial information sharing is significantly lacking among the moes the ministry of finance local government communes and schools the emis planned for the moes should be designed to collect and manage such information a team of finance experts should be engaged to design the types of data levels of recording types and level of analysis that will enhance the moes s capacity to plan and manage its activities funds raised by schools the current practices of pooling all monies raised by schools into a single account imposing a tax on the funds raised as well as the decisions made by municipalities and communes on such sums of money raised should be thoroughly overhauled schools and communities should be allowed to have full control on these incomes pooled in order to foster community ownership of school development the current rates percentages that move into the state budget will have to be re examined with the view to reducing them in order for parents and communities alike to be further encouraged the school should be permitted to have a full autonomy in using these funds raised from its own equipment and facilities resources as well as those raised by its own employees working extra hours tax exemptions for educational investments given the shrinking public sector funding for pre university education in recent years schools should be encouraged to source alternative funding to encourage benevolent contributions from the public all alternative funding should be tax exempt so that every lek given for school development is used for improving and supporting the quality of education also ngos teachers and students who purchase educational equipment such as computers should be exempted from associated taxes the government has considered this option and there are some provisions in place but their complexity deters people from seeking such exemptions there is an urgent need to simplify education tax regulations exemptions so that more people can benefit of funds pre university education is the top priority sub sector of the education system moes has agreed to regulate the expenditure in the higher education by proposing a user pays model to offset the reduced funding to other sub sectors the funds freed up by these processes will be redirected to pre university education a mentoring and reform support systems there may be a risk that some communes or local governments may not have the human capacity to run and manage schools with high degree cost effectiveness this situation could be checked by establishing partnerships between them as an alternative the ips and the moes central and regional offices may provide on going mentoring by assigning designated staff to work with the local staff a similar situation may also exist at school level where some schools may not feel comfortable with the additional tasks such as budget planning and reporting on financial management these schools may form into school clusters with a common core budget a capacity building and human resource development a conceptual shift the transition from a centralized and supply driven system to one that is based on and increased accountability and demand that is often assessed by the local authority and end users requires a fundamental conceptual shift in thinking these conceptual changes are central to ensuring changes to policies and practices at an operational level the underlying assumptions around demand driven and multi level accountability systems are particularly complex and quite alien to the country s history with communist ideology an ideology which is based on a centralized supply driven model the relationships and associated of responsibilities between central and local authorities between the state and the individual between the state and the private sector etc need to undergo considerable change under the proposed reform model this section of the nes addresses some of the significant shifts that are necessary in the education sector as part of its reform given the increasing cost to the public sector budget of providing high quality education new and more efficient systems need to be considered the government has agreed to adopt a demand based approach to increasing efficiency supported by a rigorous accounting and monitoring system built around the emis project as a result there are several specific considerations which are noted below as themes that underpin the whole nes a education as cross sector service a national education system is a service sector which has the task of ensuring that future citizens have the necessary knowledge skills and attitudes to complement the national economic development plan of the republic it the satisfaction of the national labor market needs and the socio cultural aspirations of the people however these needs and aspirations cannot be met by the education sector alone and activities such as the national curriculum framework should involve cross sector dialogue and input to ensure that the proposed framework reflects the needs of all sectors the essential nature of cross sector dialogue and coordination can be seen in those activities sponsored and supported by different ministries for example programs that tie in and target working children school food program family subsidies etc are managed by several different ministries in order to enhance and bring to a higher level their effectiveness there is a need to maximize their impact by a better coordination between them a rationalization of school distribution given the high rate of migration there is a need to develop a reliable school mapping database because through such a database more accurate and long term planning may be achieved which in turn will allow better use of the limited resources available to pre university education and unsustainable schools will need to be rationalized and alternative models for the delivery of education particularly to areas of very low density population should be developed and tried out by this means the moes will ensure that there is not only equity of access to education but also economic and administrative efficiency it is important here to differentiate between schools and classes as the unit under discussion because while the overall demand for new places and hence the demand for new schools may not increase the redistribution of students caused by internal migration may well create a need for new classrooms moes should make sure that pupils are provided access and equal chances to the offer of education this rationalization may present challenges to the regional and commune based systems where schools with small numbers of children making them exist only few kilometer apart because of district and regional boundaries but the insignificant number of pupils is rendering these schools beyond use a inspection vs facilitation the role of within the moes is currently seen as a punitive and control mechanism this has to change if teachers are to become educational professionals who are innovative and willing to engage in self development this failure in the system is the responsibility of every one associated with the task at all levels the best option is to be proactive and continuously provide support and guidance this conceptual shift is central to the success of self reporting process introduced as part of internal qa monitoring concept individuals should trust the system enough that they will report honestly otherwise the problems of inaccurate data and feedback will continue and any subsequent planning based on that data will be of little value a of teaching the current workload of teachers needs to be paid some new attention especially in relation to the status of the teachers profession unlike many eu countries teaching in the country is not regarded as a full time profession given that one of the objectives of the reform is to develop capacities and systems to align with eu and oecd countries the teaching service should be viewed as part of the public service in albania and teachers should be working a full hrs week such an approach will increase the commitment by teachers and also justify increasing their salaries one of the advantages of promoting full time employment is that economic efficiencies can be introduced by insisting on multi grade competencies for primary teachers and at least two teaching subjects for secondary teachers these suggestions may mean a reduction in the total number of teachers but it will improve the student teacher ratio bringing the albanian education system in line with other countries in the region to ensure that there is an independent monitoring of teacher quality teacher professional association and networks should be developed in many developed countries these aspects are a significant resource for improving teaching and learning processes in schools curriculum innovations and designing and evaluating textbooks a curriculum electives and education for all does not mean that every student needs to study the same subjects in the same manner the education system should be designed such that at the lower levels there is foundational knowledge that all children need to study such as basic literary and numeracy and ict competencies as students move to higher levels there should be some choice and the curriculum should have the flexibility to provide subject blocks such as social science business and economics engineering medical sciences etc as options this would allow a degree of specialization based on student choice while reducing the need to provide all subjects to all students secondary schools should have the autonomy to decide what subject combination they will offer based on local needs and stakeholder demands another aspect of curriculum choice is that many new subjects such as civics education business education multimedia and communication etc are emerging these developments mean that curriculum developers need to continuously review the subjects that are being offered and explore options such as replacing outdated subjects with new and relevant ones and or integrating related subjects into more comprehensive ones integrating subjects to enhance learning outcomes will also reduce the overall cost of textbooks these changes to the curriculum student choice and the restructuring of subjects have implications for teacher numbers textbooks and classrooms and may face considerable opposition as the current roles of many subject experts will be challenged however the curriculum developers need to access the international literature to illustrate to all stakeholders the benefits of this approach to curriculum development a research based and data driven policy development the moes has established the to engage in rigorous analytical work in the area of policy there is an urgent need to increase the number of staff in this department and to provide them with considerable capacity building in order for them to perform this task adequately the moes has also initiated the development of an emis system to collect data at various levels within the pre university education system to obtain the best outcome from the emis and the there is a need to develop a culture of continuous improvement continuous curriculum development continuous school improvements and continuous human resource development however in order to achieve worthwhile improvement all of the policy decisions regarding the education sector in general and the pre university education in particular should be based on data where data is not available the moes should either commission special research or modify the emis to allow appropriate data to be collected to obtain an accurate assessment of the issue of concern a development of vocational education in the context of the overall pre university education development strategy a an overall picture of the vocational education some background information in the framework of education the further development and consolidation of the vocational education occupies a conspicuous place in the government program in fact vocational education is considered to be a top priority the vocational education among other things aims at encouraging the thorough acquisition of new knowledge and skills bringing the school closer and closer to the world of work combating and eliminating the exclusion of youth from the direct participation in the social and economic life of the country promoting life long learning as well as the creation of equal opportunities for all in line with act no dated on vocational education and training in the republic of albania attendance at the vocational education schools takes place upon completion of the year compulsory education and consists of these types and levels a vocational education typically noted for its very practical nature equips pupils with a range of basic and indispensable competences and skills for the intentions of highly qualified vocational activities in a certain profile or craft it is structured around two levels first level lasts for years equivalent to the c category of international standard classification of education it does not necessarily end with a matura but it awards a certificate of vocational competences and it allows for a smooth transition or upward transfer to the second level of vocational education in the same profile or craft second level which lasts for years happens as such upon completion of the first level equivalent to the category a of ends with a matura and is accompanied with the release of a certificate testifying to vocational competences and abilities this level allows for enrolment in university studies in all of the branches on offer b technical secondary education equivalent to category a equips pupils with a general technical managerial culture and knowledge capable of organizing and steering vocational activities in a given profile or specialty it lasts for years after the compulsory education and it ends with a matura and the certificate to the technical vocational competences it allows students to enroll in university studies after they go through studies at such an educational level all in all there are purely technical and vocational school across the country they are for the most part spread out or located in districts where students attend studies in a range of profiles and apprentices equal to out of the total number it s easy to notice that there operate in the rural areas some vocational schools which are oriented towards the agriculture agribusiness track the number of students enrolled in the public technical vocational schools including the arts pedagogical sports and foreign language track schools termed as social cultural ones accounts for around of the pupils that attend the general secondary education this figure is comparatively low taking note of the fact that in the oecd countries this figure hovers around the region what is more this figure tends to be even higher in some other western developed countries a major characteristics and the significant problems surrounding vocational education ve despite the many reforming interventions undertaken in recent years and in particular with reference to the support provided by the various donors ve in albania aside from any noteworthy positive marks of renewal or recovery is still enjoying a low profile reputation and is continuing to fall short of playing the intended role in the current and expected developments in the country the ve today is still exhibiting the following characteristics and issues ve is still considered today to be a school based system where the theoretical and practical preparation of pupils is fulfilled mainly in the facilities of the vocational school and where possible and permissible within the spaces of an enterprise the very content of vocational qualifications is varied in nature depending on the direction profile and levels but in general it is structured as follows a relating to the year level belongs to general culture vocational theory and vocational practicum and b for the year level turns out to be of general culture vocational theory and vocational practicum admission to the public vocational schools is open to almost all of the pupils who graduate from the compulsory education while in separate cases where demands do outnumber the supply the admission is done on the basis of an entry competition administered and held in full compliance with the directives issued by moes however the number of pupils entering the vocational education is lower than that in secondary general schools it also has a direct impact in the low quality at the end of the studies funding for the ve comes straight from the state budget earmarked by the state budget for the education sector from the local governments budget the various projects by donors other supporting activities as well as the revenues raised through the many economic activities carried out by the school and other resources permissible by the law yet this funding is by no means adequate if comparison is drawn with the very needs of the sector at the moment in the ve system the functioning of the vocational guidance and career counseling as such have been formally considered and appropriately envisaged there is a lack of the pre service training system for teachers and instructors of the vocational subjects and practicum on top of this there is not any special national program on the in service training targeted at this category of teachers any training to be offered at all is of a very sporadic and erratic nature coming from the donors projects from the regional educational authorities and the former institute of pedagogical studies the same situation holds true of any training to be held for the benefit of vocational school managers and headmasters any manor interventions worthwhile have been done at the school level and any changes to take place at the system level have been completely there is a marked discrepancy among the vocational schools from the financial human resources and school facilities perspective in general the material infrastructure for the better part of vocational schools is quite poor and inadequate despite the best efforts being made at drafting any piece of legislation on ve and the coming into force of the new act on vet march it should be noted that any connection or relation of the ve to the labor market and other social partners are increasingly poor this is due to a number of reasons that relate closely to the slow pace in drafting any subsequent sub legal acts and the inactivity of mechanisms as they are projected by the laws the ve curriculum in spite of any undertakings and initiatives at and decentralization continues to be traditional by nature and distanced away from the vocational there is huge shortage of textbooks and other materials in support to the teaching and learning process teaching for the most part remains traditional to the core this trend is negatively aided by the lack of qualification for the teaching personnel the process of pupils final assessment is administered by the schools themselves in the majority of cases it lacks the effectiveness and objectivity especially with reference to the vocational practicum this in turn leads to the low reputation surrounding the various competence certificates issued by most vocational schools a objective goals of vocational education in view of the coming decade the vocational education ve should be oriented more and more towards a systematic reform it should respond to the ever changing needs of ve in a system capable of adapting to the uncertainty and in sustainability of employment underpinning the changing demands of the labor markets this reform should go beyond the purely institutional transformations and not fall short of such a target as such it will call for radical changes affecting the vision the set of attitudes and behaviors of all people be they stakeholders or various social partners the actual development trends in ve should be oriented towards goals that lead up to the establishment of a far more attractive ve that offers access to all interested parties and far bigger employment opportunities allowing for transition to the higher levels ex tertiary level ve should be elevated is such a position as to facilitate any immediate reaction to the developments and the demands of the labor market at the regional national and local level it will have to be effective and be based on a partnership model that engages in all its activities all of the stakeholders government social partners and communities at the basis of it all should be placed the underlying concept of life long learning such a system should help establish the opportunity for the accumulation transferring and recognition of all credits gained and obtained in different forms and manners step by step it will have to fit in snugly with the level of qualifications already acknowledged and accepted by the european union generally speaking it should be pointed out that any developments in ve being an integral part of pre university education will be realized in fine tune with government program and the prime objectives of national strategy for the development of pre university education the following set of objectives in ve take due account of the developments in recent years not only in albania but also in the region and beyond at the same time they make special reference to the most important documents published by eu that enjoy a relevance to the specific features of the ve sector from the structural perspective of the ve system increasing the flexibility of the choice of offers admission opportunities advancement and vertical and horizontal mobility among the levels and profiles in ve through a establishment of a national framework of vocational qualifications which will consist of levels of vocational qualifications and benchmarks descriptive figures of these levels from the perspective of vocational standards directions profiles and apprentices of the vocational qualifications and respective descriptions standards for each level evaluation criteria testing against the set of standards contained within the description of certificates for the vocational qualifications recognized at the national and international level b adapting and adjusting the structure of the ve system relying mostly on and taking into account the recommending levels of european framework of qualifications entry level into the work sector which awards certificates on the basic vocational competences the level of qualified employee worker which offers certificates of the vocational competences the technical managerial level which offers the diploma of the technical matura c establishment of a special cycle in order to complete the general culture of pupils who complete the level of the qualified worker in order to offer the diploma of the technical matura d establishment of the post secondary vocational oriented cycle for pupils who complete the general secondary education and who seek to obtain a vocational qualification from the quantitative viewpoint the major indicator of expected developments during this period will be doubling the drawing in rate of pupils in the vocational technical and social cultural schools from the current rate of secondary education to about figure from the curriculum perspective of ve modernizing the curricula model in order to align it with the demands of the labor market and increasing or raising the level of flexibility though the following a the two tier curriculum structure of vet decentralized with curricula framework as a national standard of the relevant vocational qualification drawn up developed at the central level and with a school based curricula based on the respective curricula framework on the real demands of the labor market and the real opportunities of schools b the gradual of the ve curricula in order to facilitate the integration of vocational competences and occupational standards and to facilitate the accumulation transferring and recognition of credits earned by pupils c a methodology of drafting the ve curricula that is based on the occupation analysis which considers the compilation of curricula as an ongoing and multi faceted process and which commits all interested persons in this process d supporting the ve curricula with integral textbooks which are to be in use for a relatively long period of time by a huge number of pupils for all levels and directions by helping reduce considerably the costs incurred by their production from the institutional perspective development of institutional mechanisms for the administration of new functions and support given to the current functions of ve through a empowering the roles of national council of vet specialized committees and the respective secretariat as a three party consultative body government employer and employee in support of developing the reforming policies on vet b establishing the national agency of vet in order to carry out the following cross sector functions there seems to be some failure towards accomplishing such functions on the part of central and vet institutions constantly drafting and reviewing the national list of vocations and the accompanying descriptions drafting and reviewing constantly the with the description of standards for all levels and profiles the evaluation criteria and certifications drafting and reviewing constantly the curriculum framework of the vocational qualifications drafting and reviewing constantly the manual of accreditation of institutions that offer vocational qualifications conducting the needs analysis on vocational qualifications at the national level establishing and updating the databank in relation to curriculum framework accreditation needs for vocational qualifications etc that relate to vet c empowering the vocational school boards with social partners employers and employees d establishing departments on vocational basis at the vocational schools as units of developing and adapting the curricula at the school level as well as the internal training of teachers and instructors alike e establishing national mechanism on the vocational orientation and career counseling with the support of the social partners from the human resources perspective of vet building teaching and managerial competences of the ve personnel through establishing an institutional mechanism on qualification pre service on the basis of pedagogy and psychology of new teachers and instructors of ve empowering the actual institutional mechanisms at the central and school level on the in service training both and vocational of all teachers and instructors of ve empowering the actual institutional mechanisms for the training of vocational schools in connection with the specifics of management in this sector from the legal financial perspective completing and supplementing the normative legal framework of ve with acts decisions ordinances and other regulations with all the relevant reforming changes and transformations in this sector through drafting a special act the national framework of vocational qualifications as well as the sub legal acts in support of this vital and central component to a modern system of vet establishing a legal environment for the development of non public ve establishing a legal environment that allows for a bigger engagement and involvement of schools in economic activities with the view to increasing quality in training pupils and raising additional or extra incomes from the infrastructure perspective of ve quantitative and qualitative development of the teaching environment and teaching aids in support of the projected qualitative and quantitative increase of the ve offer through redesigning the existing facilities for the theoretical and practical teaching process at the vocational schools equipping with the necessary material and basis for a theoretical and practical teaching process establishing opening of new schools in those regions where the demand is much higher or transferring the destination of some general secondary schools to vocational schools of course this will have to be accompanied with other interventions at the school level restructuring school buildings creating new workshops and renewing their equipment sources reviewing the qualifications offered changes in the school personnel optimizing the extent and size of schools establishing the regional and national vocational schools in order to better align the supply with the demand and to reduce drastically the costs of such a public service this means that after the reorganization process the end of there will be an increase in the number of pupils per school from the figure as it stands now to pupils this could be made possible by way of constructions editions schools coming under the same roof freeing up any school space upon by use of force as well better making use of the existing capacities cooperation among ve vocational education and business in order to use in a mutual manner the infrastructure of these actors to the intent of better training professionally the pupils and the course attendees all of the above and other similar reforming interventions not dealt with at the moment will contribute significantly to raising quality of ve and delivering on the quantitative goal that over the next years there will be a doubling of attendance in this sector in order to better deliver on these objectives which are to stem from a more detailed and comprehensive analysis into the current status and the

plan this section maps out the sequencing and approximate timing for the implementation of various activities noted in sections a and b above in accord with the adopted format for national education strategy each of the priority areas have been dealt with separately mapping key activities along respective timelines it must be noted that a national education strategy is a macro level document and hence is not able to deal with micro level details of all activities and associated procedures further operational plans with details for each activity will need to be developed as specific project designs are undertaken the proposed schedule assumes that implementation of the strategy will begin in year if for some reason there happens to be a delay the schedule can be pushed back by a corresponding period of time it is important to maintain the sequence of activities as many are planned for progressively upgrading c governance reforming and strengthening management capacity

approximate units costs aggregated from previous similar activities undertaken by moes institute for curriculum development local ngo s and ingo s while such information provided some basis to estimate costs it must be noted that these figures are still very crude thus the estimates provided in the summary should be treated cautiously the computation of costs is based on the following assumptions foreign technical assistance fta input is usd per day this includes travel accommodation and fees local expert input is usd per day this includes travel accommodation and fees local participants will be paid a lump sum basis a sum of usd per day the lump sum payment will include travel accommodation and costs for room hire rental of equipment and other associated with conducting workshops training etc are not factored into the costing presented here neither is any inflationary cost or variation that may occur due to the fluctuation of the usd to appreciate the cost calculation process see part e it provides a narrative against the resource input matrices which in turn guides the process of establishing cost estimates an aggregate cost for activities noted under each of the key areas of the national strategy is presented below d governance reforming and strengthening management capacity d reforming the central office d decentralization d school autonomy d educational management information system d reporting and quality assurance total d improving the quality of the teaching and learning process d curriculum development d teacher development d textbook development d alternative teaching resources d examinations and monitoring total d financing pre university education d composition of education finance d instruments and processes for transfer of funds d increasing efficiency in the sub sector funding d investment program d mentoring and support systems total d capacity building and human resource development a conceptual shift d education as cross sector service d rationalization of school distribution d inspection vs facilitation d of teaching d curriculum electives and d research based and data driven policy development total the estimated total cost over the ten years to implement the reforms will cost usd over the next years it must be noted that substantial part of this sum is for capital works such as school rehabilitation part e resource input matrices the information in the matrices is organized in the following manner major considerations for determining the costs are listed as heading for the various columns many of the activities and the expected outcomes overlap thus shading is used to group activities consulting inputs seminar workshop and numbers of participants etc for example in appendix e the fta and local experts have and months input respectively to undertake all tasks that are shaded similarly in the same matrix the number of people participating in the training program is grouped in lots of people by respective the time allocated for each activity is minimum total time how this time is distribution to achieve the objectives is to be determined when preparing detailed design of each individual activity however the minimum time noted is critical if sufficient level of proficiency is to be achieved it is assumed that the proposed minimum training is necessary to begin the reform process and which will get integrated into the daily activities of moes and supported through moes grants as professional development for continuous improvement the resource equipment noted in the matrix includes only the very essential items a lack of accurate data on what was available within the sub sector and often conflicting data made it difficult to be very precise nevertheless we believe that all significant resource data that impact on the implementation of the national education strategy is covered the number of workshops training seminars is also indicative only and kept to minimum requirement the proposed numbers were decided to ensure reasonable levels of engagement from all levels and all stakeholders the numbers of participants expected to be involved in specific seminars and the departments and levels of the departments that should be represented noted in the matrix to ensure people that are directly related to performing the necessary tasks attend the training the rows aligned to each activity heading present a summary of input for each activity and under the cost estimate the total cost for that activity is noted this amount is transferred to the cost summary in section d this section provides a narrative to describe the assumptions used to map and calculate the costs the need to for international and local experts with specialized technical assistance is deemed critical for successful implementation of the project the additional funding is necessary to either buy time of current staff and or appoint new staff to work intensively on the reform activities previous experience in albania and other developing countries have shown that existing moes staffs when asked to take on additional tasks related to education reform are reluctant as it is often an overload such overloaded workers are unable to deliver on their tor and put the reform activities at risk training and capacity building minimum number of training days allocated for the activity by proposed number of workshops days for each workshop days for each workshop by the number of participants number of days number of days x usd per day total cost for the activity rehabilitation costs estimates were made on the basis of work undertaken under the wb credit alb which finished in school were rehabilitated a cost of usd approx average cost per schools usd approx of schools not rehabilitated yet schools therefore total cost for rehabilitating schools usd to be spread over years textbook costs were provided by the textbook specialist in moes a unit cost of approx usd was suggest for books in the primary grades it includes the design development and publishing costs however in the absence of any recent costs for compulsory and secondary text books the above unit cost was used to estimate the government share of funding the textbook for pre university grades thus is it important that the total costs for textbook be treated with caution and be reviewed
