system of long term priorities for sustainable development in the state administration reg no cz dear readers dear fellow citizens ladies and gentlemen we are pleased to present the strategic framework czech republic the result of two years of hard work contributed by many people institutions and organisations the wide scope of cooperation makes it a document which goes beyond government departments but also i believe it is a well presented document that works across political parties its strength and ability to convince stem from the fact that it captures a consensual view of strengths and weaknesses of our country and that it goals crucial for long term development of the czech republic thanks to this approach the czech republic proves it belongs to the family of well developed countries which are responsible not only for themselves but also for global development sustainable development represents respect for the world that we have inherited from our ancestors it stands for respect for the limits of nature and our planet as well as for the provision of the same opportunities for development for generations to come quality water available water quality soil and diverse landscape are not to be taken for granted and they represent our common interests a sustainable world appreciates their complexity and mutual context it is respectful towards humans and their society it excludes no one however efforts for a sustainable world do not seek to preserve it they seek to improve it these efforts strive to create fundamentals for a life of quality and dignity for all of us functional families and communities public service that is of high quality and available dignified work these are the foundation stones for a cohesive society a green and blossoming economy stands upon them contributing to the stabilisation of economic institutions while at the same time developing people s creative abilities i am glad to see that today we are already able to find innovative and progressive industrial solutions and implement them into our lives i hope we will see them soon for example in the responsible use of land dignified living and adapting our cities to the impacts of climate change as well wherever we live whether in cities or in the countryside they are essential to our satisfaction and if we look after these places properly then it will improve our quality of life we are only able to handle the challenges if the state administration adjusts its workings to suit the needs of its citizens increases its effectiveness and includes the citizens in the process of policy preparation at all levels we are only able to tackle the problems we are facing once all of us feel that our efforts and engagement are meaningful it is therefore necessary to create and expand opportunities to include citizens since building a civil society is an inherently never ending process obviously we share many problems regardless of our convictions it is in the interest of all of us to preserve the world as a place to live and to hand it over to future generations in a better shape than we received it if possible however we have not been successful in achieving this for some time czech republic was created as a set of instructions for the public administration to change this situation transitioning to the sustainable way of life places demands on each of us that is why czech republic mainly represents a challenge to go through with this transition a hand reaching out to all who do not view the future with indifference czech republic is our shared future let us shape it together sobotka contents introduction vision how should the czech republic look in executive summary principles of sustainable development summary of analysis of the

bibliography appendices dear readers we are pleased to present the strategic framework czech republic called czech republic it is a result of an update to the strategic framework of sustainable development accepted by the government in the update commission has been approved through the government resolution of july no on the sustainable development agenda the strategic framework is a result of an extensive participative process that has been taking place since september firstly it was coordinated by the department and then by the division for sustainable development of the office of the government of the czech republic learn more about the whole update process on the website www vlada cz bookmark advisory and working bodies the government council for sustainable development since it is a document covering a wide range of topics we made its navigation and utilisation as straightforward as possible the first three sections introduction vision and principles of sustainable development define the basic development approach introduce the process of the document creation and describe the general vision of development up to the year this is followed by a summary of the development analysis in the form of six swot analyses of strengths and weaknesses opportunities and threats one for each key topic area these swot analyses state the main conclusions of analytical works that preceded the creation of draft sections of the individual key areas and their goals the complete analysis of development forms the entire annex no of the strategic framework visions extended for each area have been formulated in the key areas and a desirable direction of development in the corresponding topic areas have been presented each key area is concluded by a list of strategic goals and their specifications in the form of specific objectives indicators in annex no are designed to measure fulfilment of these specific objectives at the beginning of each key area there is a graphic overview of sustainable development goals set by the united nations with highlighted goals related to the given key area for ease of the paragraphs of key areas are numbered each of the key areas has its own numerical series which always begins with etc furthermore the paragraphs include summary descriptions in the left column the footnotes include brief information that allows the reader to easily find the source in the bibliography listed at the end departments strategic and conceptual documents stated are usually available in the strategy database www strategie cz introduction czech republic is a strategic framework that indicates the direction the development of our country and society should take in the decades to come fulfilling it should improve the quality of life in the czech republic and point our country towards development sustainable in terms of social economic and environmental aspects the document forms a basic framework for other strategic documents on national regional and local levels it cannot replace sector documents and it does not aspire to do so with regards to links with these documents it indicates areas that are decisive in terms of long term development of the czech republic specific steps leading to fulfilment of its objectives fall under the corresponding ministries and the office of the government of the czech republic it is desirable that fulfilling the objectives set out in czech republic is also reflected in regional and local policies and everyday life of all citizens the strategic framework is not only designed for public administration all citizens companies social partners and not for profit organisations are invited and encouraged to actively participate to fulfil its objectives czech republic replaces the strategic framework of sustainable development accepted by the government in it constitutes part of our common effort for sustainable development in the european union and at the same time it is a contribution of the czech republic to fulfil the global sustainable development objectives adopted by the united nations in these global objectives are common for all however each state decides on the specific contents of the objectives depending on its own specifics as well as on the specific ways to meet them by restoring the activity of the government council for sustainable development in and especially by creating the capacity to provide the sustainable development agenda at the office of the government of the czech republic division of sustainable development the czech republic is continuing its long term operations in the sustainable development agenda both on a domestic and international level transferring the responsibility to the office of the government has emphasised the strategic and cross sectional importance of this agenda czech republic stems from two main approaches quality of life and sustainability the quality of life perspective reminds us that the progress in society cannot be evaluated solely using economic indicators for example gnp increases even when we are stuck in a traffic jam and consuming fuel the contribution made to the quality of life is at least debatable apart from a macroeconomic perspective we also need to take into account individuals families and societies and various aspects of their mutual interactions quality of life presumes investments into human potential as a basis for development organisation for economic cooperation and development therefore recommends monitoring various parameters of quality of life e g health balance between work life and personal life education and skills interpersonal relationships civic engagement environment quality personal safety and subjectively perceived life happiness naturally these attributes are predominantly but not completely determined by material conditions i e income wealth employment and profits oecd measuring well being and progress introduction principles of sustainability remind us that society s development is influenced by the physical limits of our planet and landscape most natural resources are finite by consuming them excessively we may damage our society burdening our development with natural debts czech republic accepts that humans are part of nature however it concentrates on people and their needs the act no col on the environment states that sustainable development is such a development that meets the needs of the present generations without compromising the ability to fulfil them to future generations while not reducing the diversity of nature and preserving the natural functions of ecosystems the sustainable development perspective has tended in recent years to become the main subject of political debates in europe and around the world it tackles the contemporary world s hot issues such as climate change demographic changes loss of fertile soil and increasing inequality it also concerns increasing the way we all connect with the present world which forces us to look at the world in context and take into account the responsibility of each state to the global community czech republic was being formed at the time when the global community formulated its vision of the future world at the united nations in objectives of sustainable development the idea of development as a matter for developing countries has changed each country has a responsibility to its citizens and the environment and the responsibility and development are never ending processes during preparations of the strategic document the international community also adopted a new paris agreement under the united nations framework convention on climate change with ambitious goals the agreement is also complemented by the global plan of action on disaster risk reduction the awareness that climate change needs to be prevented and prepared for and that we need to identify and manage risk related to it has also been growing in the czech society mainly because of visible negative impacts e g torrential rains droughts and other extreme weather conditions the czech republic has to think its future through bearing in mind the complexity and of the present world that is why czech republic puts the development of our country in the context of global development it uses the concept of so called global these are development tendencies on a global level we presume they will significantly influence the ability to fulfil the development objectives set in czech republic in the future one of the keys to sustainable development is the ability to make decisions in the long term perspective being aware of tremendous uncertainty and taking into account various impacts of the solution selected that is why this strategic framework is now also thoroughly concerned with the issue of governance czech republic understands the topic of security as part of a more general problem of resilience of societal and ecological systems maintaining security in the narrower sense of the word handling issues of defence and international security or issues such as spreading weapons of mass destruction organised crime and criminality in general terrorism or extremism is conceptually covered sufficiently by existing strategic materials on the basis of which necessary measures are taken however the resilience is two part in terms of sustainable development the first part is resilience against various unexpected hazards or more specifically the capacity to foresee and manage crisis situations whether of natural or man made origin this capacity universally complements identified security threats existing activities in the field of security reflect it and czech republic therefore only puts it into strategic framework czech republic the context of sustainable development the other part is resilience in the form of wide range prevention on one hand and tools of adaptation to change on the other hand this dimension of resilience is emphasised in czech republic in comparison to current strategic materials from the field of security czech republic sums up the progress made by the czech republic what risks it is facing and what opportunities lie ahead in six key areas the document strategic and specific objectives for each of these areas apart from three traditional pillars of development social environmental and economic the key areas also concern the life in regions and municipalities the czech contribution to development on a global level as well as good governance the division of the strategic document into six areas stems from expert assessment of these in response to the appeal by the prime minister and the chairman of the government council for sustainable development which addressed all advisory bodies of the government and not for profit organisation networks czech republic is the result of more than a one year participative process taking place within the government council for sustainable development and led by the department and subsequently the division for sustainable development of the office of government of the czech republic hundreds of participants from various sectors of society were involved including committees and task forces of the government council for sustainable development the preparation followed the assessment that verified the extent of fulfilment of the strategic framework for sustainable development in the years to the adoption of czech republic will be followed by an implementation document that shall provide its link to further documents and indicate specific measures to ensure its fulfilment the office of the government of the czech republic shall coordinate this implementation the government council for sustainable development and its committees shall have the supporting role of an expert network the implementation shall also include monitoring of accordance with specific programmes and measures the set of indicators in czech republic serves to measure the progress in meeting specific objectives and also as a foundation for regular assessment reports processing see strategic framework implementation for more information on this process see http www vlada cz cz o ceska republika the assessment is available here http www vlada cz assets cr pdf vision how should the czech republic look in in the czech republic is a democratic legal state based on respect to civic political economic and social rights of its citizens and has developed its identity based on its culture it provides a good quality of life for its population and at the same time respects natural and territorial limits and protects biological diversity it also purposefully helps to meet these values elsewhere in the world sustainable development of the czech republic is measured through improvements in the quality of life for each individual as well as in society as a whole it fulfils the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to fulfil theirs the czech republic is a cohesive active and energetic society of equal opportunities it structural and social inequality society and its decision making structures are resilient and flexible able to recognise possible development risks in time and respond rationally to unexpected changes and to the ever changing dynamic of global development resilience of societal relations and structures and factual problem solving are strengthened with discussion and agreement executive summary czech republic is a strategic framework for long term development of czech society the objective of which is to improve the quality of life of all inhabitants of the czech republic while respecting natural limits based on the structural analysis of the contemporary condition and trends the document strategic and specific objectives the czech republic should fulfil by the year their fulfilment will be the responsibility of relevant central bodies of the state administration at the same time the strategic framework shall also serve as a guide for development of regions and municipalities czech republic connects two major concepts quality of life and sustainable development quality of life cannot be measured exclusively by economic indicators such as gnp on the contrary evaluating it requires monitoring of other aspects of human life as well such as health balance between work life and personal life education and skills interpersonal relationships civic engagement environment quality personal safety and subjectively perceived life happiness we must monitor sustainability and evaluate it also in terms of resource and energy intensity czech republic is the result of a process taking place within the government council for sustainable development and led by the department and subsequently the division for sustainable development of the office of government of the czech republic the division was created in as a coordinating body for the sustainable development agenda that was now the responsibility of the prime minister this significantly contributes to perceiving its importance and facilitates solving problems and topics beyond ministries abroad this structure is considered to be a paragon of good practice the document preparation began in and hundreds of experts were involved the document has been consulted with more than organisations and institutions from the civic private and academic sectors nine expert committees of the government council for sustainable development provided major support in this process czech republic replaces the strategic framework for sustainable development from and other conceptual documents in this field its preparation has been influenced by the adoption of agenda for sustainable development and its sustainable development objectives created by the united nations in september as well as the adoption of the paris agreement under the united nations framework convention on climate change czech republic serves as a foundation for the assessment of development of the czech republic and its global responsibility the government will report regularly on the fulfilment of the sustainable development objectives in the united nations the first report is due in july in its introduction the document six cross sectional principles of sustainable development and indicates how to apply them in the creation of public policies czech republic its objectives across a total of six key areas people and society economic model resilient ecosystems municipalities and regions global development and good governance the key areas have been appointed on the basis of theses prepared on the development acquired from key participants compared to the strategic framework for sustainable development of the czech republic the topic of governance proved to be an important topic and it has recently been recognised as an autonomous key area the document also takes into account the external context of development of the czech republic executive summary and concerns so called global and their impact on strategic objectives for the development of the czech republic people and society in terms of society the czech republic has a range of structural advantages it has a universal system of social protection that successfully performs the function of a contemporary safety net in international comparison the czech republic shows low general income inequality has a stable public education system a good level of education and quality healthcare available in recent years the general unemployment rate has been decreasing however the rate of long term unemployed within the total unemployment rate is growing despite that there are some crucial challenges identified in terms of long term development the danger of poverty is above average in certain population groups the elderly single parent families there are gender inequalities in society the social economic background of students significantly determines the results of their education people are living longer but they end their days suffering from diseases and general health is significantly influenced by social economic conditions trends of demographic ageing progressive and job market will continue to significantly influence the development of society dealing with these trends in favour of quality of life will constitute a major task of public policies by the strategic document suggests increasing investments into prevention and health literacy strengthening system support for educators as bearers of change in the education system maintaining the employment rate via development of the green and silver economy and increased involvement of underrepresented groups on the job market economic model the economy of the czech republic must find new sources of growth after depleting the growth model based on an influx of direct investments from abroad the key aspect is support of innovative initiatives in small and medium enterprises which have the biggest growth potential as well as in large companies which form the largest part of the economy however the economy must grow without increasing consumption of resources and energy at the same pace therefore the objective is to cancel the dependence of economic growth on the growth of material and energetic consumption so called decoupling by the year another technological opportunity and at the same time a contribution to the international efforts to mitigate climate change is gradual of the economy economic development depends on adaptation and maintenance of the infrastructure which is also a security element bringing the desirable resilience in the future sustainable public finance must be able to cope with changes in income structure new requirements for expenses and also to provide efficient distribution of public resources resilient ecosystems ecosystems of the czech republic are under significant pressure from intensive agriculture and forestry which contribute to soil degradation and decrease its ability to retain water there is more landscape fragmentation and less biological diversity a significant part of the surface water is contaminated by discharge from fields and by waste water we need to reverse those trends by and achieve a gradual improvement of the contemporary strategic framework czech republic conditions we can use synergy between improvement in soil fertility carbon capture and storage in the form of organic matter and retaining water in the landscape the restoration of ecosystem services may be provided by suitably adjusted conditions of farming distribution of subsidies will depend on fulfilment of these conditions synergy between the necessary landscape restoration and creation of jobs in the country in landscape maintenance and tourism will also contribute to balanced regional development municipalities and regions inequalities between municipalities and regions are growing they manifest mainly through the occurrence of internal and poor availability of public services and amenities as well as a result of the outflow of the younger and more educated population to cities at the same time municipalities and regions have been dealing with the consequences of gradual that has also gradually been affecting smaller settlements the gradual urban sprawl also leads to poorer availability of public services increases forced mobility and related negative phenomena for example health threatening factors induced by an increase in traffic cities and municipalities will also have to start accepting measures for adaptation to climate change and prevent its impact by climate change is the typical example that by its cross sectional nature imposes complex demands on municipalities their representatives and expert bodies however some cities and municipalities have yet to face those demands because they are still struggling with various problems such as an unclear situation in terms of competence between the national administration and municipal administration shortcomings in governance effectiveness quality and legitimacy including involvement of the public by it is therefore necessary to support municipalities and regions in planning in spaces smaller than regions and transcending territory of a single municipality that will take into account functional relations we will also need to develop a network of services in the territory and cooperation among municipalities support emission free transport provide new uses for brownfield sites and city centres reduce greenhouse gas emissions and take adaptation measures such as better care for greenery in cities or mitigation measures e g in the form of passive energy civil engineering global development the czech republic accepts its global responsibility and it will continue to cooperate on the development of the global environment suitable for sustainable development affirmation by the impact of domestic policies on development in other countries will be assessed regularly and the czech republic will strengthen the coordination of its representation within international organisations good governance good governance is the basic prerequisite for long term development in this area czech republic identifies several crucial challenges such as decreasing the extent of political participation via traditional channels political parties and elections weak ability of horizontal coordination of the public administration limited ability to work when making decisions with long term perspective poor involvement with contemporary international debate and severely limited ability to innovate the governance it is therefore necessary to executive summary strengthen all mechanisms by that provide policy coherence develop an innovative environment in public administration improve representative and strengthen participative and elements of democracy strengthen data knowledge and skill capacity of the public administration and develop a system for sharing data and information both inside the public administration as well as with citizens these principles should be adopted at all levels of public administration in order to provide implementation of the strategic document czech republic an autonomous implementation document will be adopted that will assess fulfilment of contemporary specific objectives and identify the space for adjustment of existing policies or potential for adoption of new policies or measures the objectives of the strategic framework czech republic will be fulfilled via measures on a national and regional level the division for sustainable development of the government office will prepare an analytical report on the quality of life and its sustainability every two years this report will assess the condition and trends in quality of life and its sustainability in the czech republic on the basis of indicators representatives of other sectors will be invited to prepare and challenge it the report will also include recommendations on a possible update of the strategic framework czech republic represents a vision of long term development to which non state participants must also contribute that is why it will be possible to apply to fulfil its objectives via so called voluntary commitments the implementation will also include strengthened sustainability in the internal workings of government and administration offices on a national regional and municipal level and methodical support of the office of government in the application of sustainable development principles in the decision making of central bodies of state administration principles of sustainable development czech republic sets out the principles specified below that are reflected in all key areas and presents possible practical ways to fulfil them in specific policies let us keep in mind that sustainable development is a complex and dynamic system the human world is one whole each division into environmental social and economic interests is secondary all these areas are interconnected that is why it is necessary to approach them in an integrated manner and respect the need to maintain a complex and dynamic balance in time and space that can be achieved by striving for balance between the three pillars of sustainable development via strategic planning and management the result should be coherent interconnected policies for sustainable development that communicate with the whole society including all sectors stemming from objective division of the decision making power which are to be implemented throughout all decision making levels from the top down their contribution is not only to be measured by expense but also by their external manifestations and impact let us support and maintain diversity stable complex systems are usually in a condition of dynamic balance higher diversity lowers the risk of collapse of entire ecosystems however diversity is crucially important not only in natural ecosystems but also in social cultural political and economic spheres sustainable development includes diversity of perspectives and tolerance for difference these manifest practically for example in the following principles the principles of partnership equal opportunities inclusion preventative caution cohesion and global responsibility diversity also entails acknowledging that environmental protection is a necessary part of the development process and it has to be assessed alongside other aspects let us respect basic human rights sustainable development is not possible without respecting the principle of equality freedom and rights of all people their mutual solidarity responsibility and tolerance in terms of achieving the highest quality of life of individuals as well as society that is why sustainable development respects basic values of human society both individual the right to life freedom security education equality equal opportunities etc and collective global and intergenerational responsibility security solidarity social cohesion let us participate discuss be transparent and seek non violent conflict resolution another necessary prerequisite of sustainable development is transparency understood not only as sufficient information on the decision making processes of the state and institutions but also the quality and of the background policies must be based not only on the results of quality scientific knowledge but also on participation i e involvement of the public having access to sufficient quality and comprehensible information at the same time the political principle of i e decision making at the lowest principles of sustainable development possible level must respect the attitudes of various social groups decisions asserted by force are not sustainable in the long term perspective let us learn another one of the fundamental sustainable development principles is the increasing rate of knowledge across all areas however this also includes the ability to put such knowledge to use pass it on in education and hone the skill of learning from experience cooperation between the public administration and science institutions is therefore essential as well as the application of its results in strategic planning with deeper knowledge the respect for cultural heritage grows the knowledge of sustainable patterns of production and consumption leads to more provident processes and knowledge of natural sciences contribute to a greater understanding of ecosystems a quality system of education parenting and enlightenment is important for a sustainable society which allows various spheres of society to use the knowledge they receive let us think globally and long term but act locally life is not simply about the here and now many forms of impact only become evident over time we notice them only when taking a long term perspective that is why we must think all our decisions through very carefully we should abide by the following principles the principle of intergenerational solidarity responsibility and transparency international responsibility preventative caution and preventing negative phenomena adaptation to long term trends building an infrastructure with respect to critical elements which could seriously impact national security if disrupted the principle of securing basic life needs of the state population health and the state economy we should also keep in mind risk reduction ecosystem preservation reasonable expense deviation from unsustainable patterns of production and consumption growth of the range of the circular economy transforming the economy to one that is less demanding in terms of energy and resources and other issues such as waste management recycling etc summary of analysis of the czech republic development strategic and specific goals of czech republic stem from a detailed analysis capturing contemporary structural challenges and opportunities as well as significant trends that influence the development of our society in the future the complete analysis of development forms the entire annex no of the strategic framework the following part outlines conclusions of the development analysis for each key area in the form of a swot chart that describes

prefer purposeful consumption both material and non material needs of individuals are met while environmental impacts and social exclusion are introduction narrowing the issue of development exclusively to its economic and public policies aiming to improve quality of life technical aspects would lead to losing its actual contents that concerns human dignity the primary objective of public policies is to improve the quality of life of all inhabitants while simultaneously respecting development s natural limits impact of demographic in the future the quality of life will be significantly improved by trends ageing and such as population ageing and related demands for provision of sufficient change in the job market manpower for the job market increased needs of personal care and

economic and technological development must not compromise human dignity state guaranteed public services will remain crucial in the future as well they must be able to respond adequately not only to the aforementioned trends but also to risks strategic framework czech republic that are difficult to predict or foresee even today e g natural catastrophes terrorism or economic crises systems of public health and social insurance including pensions constitute the basic pillar of public services the state will continue to develop further systems of public health and social insurance in order to provide an improving quality of public services cooperation between the public services have a key task they have to be available to all state and the communities inhabitants of the czech republic at a standard that is sufficient now and in the future based on long term population growth in order to improve their quality of life with respect to specific problems of communities and rapid dynamics of change it is necessary for the state to cooperate with institutions of other kinds with respect to the principle and on all levels from supranational institutions and neighbouring

therefore the state will contribute mainly to consumer protection against the possibility of purchase of dangerous products and services protect their rightful economic interest and support consumer education with a primary focus on children and young people up to years of age on the elderly and people with health impairments furthermore it will improve the effectiveness of market supervision performed by the existing state bodies and strengthen law among other things due to the development of the newly introduced system of out of court solutions to consumer the czech republic will also contribute to the change of lifestyle leading to a preference of sustainable consumption in order to protect the environment and it will also support social cohesion by making efforts to achieve

nature it also has a social dimension since it fulfils basic social functions with respect to all irreplaceable functions of the family within society appraisal and support for families is insufficient which has a decisive impact on the demographic ageing of the population family policy is an inherent part of the entire social and economic comprehensively focused system and within it it may play a significant pro growth role family policy and intergenerational family is complex to understand mainly as a pro growth programme of long term policy investments into human capital furthermore as support for families dealing with standard life situations but also as prevention against new social risks stemming from demographic ageing changes in family structure etc efficient policy supporting families in all its basic functions pro family policy is founded on an acknowledgement of family autonomy a family as a unit when working properly proves beneficial for the entire society a major element of the successful development of a society is children s upbringing in their family with that in mind we need to create conditions in which people may implement their ideas of the number of children arrival of another child may not bring potential risk of poverty a risk of poverty is considered to be income lower than the standard established limit on the level of of median balanced disposable income per consumption unit material position of families one of the important factors when people decide whether to have with children children or how many children is the material position of families with children that represents the standard of living of families with children both in the sense of an absolute standard average income per consumption unit and a relative standard expressed by a comparison of their material situation to childless people on the same gross income level expenditure for fulfilling family functions do not have adequate economic compensation that is why the state will consider more closely ever increasing expenditure and the value of missed opportunities related to childcare and parenting balancing personal life and another measure of the pro family policy concerns public services for work life families housing support and support of flexible forms of employment working from home part time employment flexible working hours etc as well as financial and local availability of preschool and early years childcare that will allow for better work life balance on the basis of needs and free choice of parents the work life

sufficient manpower for the job market it is necessary to operate systematically to induce change in stereotypes with certain employers who do not appreciate the significance of parenthood and family background for personal growth of their employees and they disadvantage their employees who take care of children or elderly members of the family attention paid to families with it is also necessary to pay particular attention to families in special special needs situations mainly to single parent families families with members who have special needs families with three or more children and other families with special needs who are simultaneously mostly affected by both relative and absolute poverty it is necessary to take specific measures that contribute to members of such families having equal access to education the role they play on the job market and in society and therefore not being at risk of social exclusion the state will help single parent families to make sure they have maintenance for their children the state shall support strengthening local communities is one of the pillars of development functioning communities the basic prerequisite for community development in

potential of the elderly to share their experience with younger workers among other things for example via various forms of intergenerational this seems desirable also because elderly citizens living

efficient coordination of a wide range of activities that may through public services influence the individual causes of homelessness and ongoing homeless situations using social work and social

autonomous universities should continue to fulfil their irreplaceable role in society centres of education by developing their four basic and equally significant functions firstly their importance as autonomous and independent centres of new knowledge and innovations that bring benefits to the whole of society in the form of new information products and services secondly their importance as centres of education where knowledge wisdom and type of thinking are passed on to people and enable personal development thirdly as institutions preparing highly qualified experts for the world of work and finally they are important as spaces for the development of active citizenship considered necessary for the further functioning of democratic society the role of university education continues to expand by society becoming increasingly complex and interwoven and by the growing role of modern technologies as well as the necessity to manage very complex learning universities must be able to respond to major changes in society however they must not do so at the expense of autonomy and academic freedom it is utterly crucial that universities are accessible to anyone regardless of their social or economic position and remain a public asset and public responsibility including the corresponding level of financing science and research as a science research and development provides the basic means to the path to knowledge and long term achievement of innovations and to the management of economic innovations social environmental and other changes quality research and scientific activity is also a foundation for quality education at a university level in order for scientific and research activities to be truly beneficial for the whole of society in the long term perspective it is necessary to preserve the major role of basic research that is crucial for example for the long term support of applied r d among other things it is simply impossible to subordinate r d to

support effective health protection in order to operate effective health protection and disease supported by public budget prevention we need the provision of sufficient finance both from the state

companies efficiently to support health and prevent diseases health literacy is an efficient the state shall invest more into disease prevention support of health tool and development of so called health literacy of the population health literacy is the ability to expand knowledge and skills so that people become able to decide for their own health as well as for health in their environment and the ability to navigate through the complex system of healthcare and social care however the approach of individuals to fulfilment of their own healthy lifestyles and their responsibility for their own health is also important adopt a healthy lifestyle in a in order to further improve our health we need to significantly reduce healthy environment the amount of harmful substances and noise hazardous emissions of including a good diet pollutant from home solid fuel heaters coal and wood hazardous emissions of pollutants from diesel and petrol powered motors mainly in traffic pah b a p pm

positive lifestyle changes in terms of quality of life such as limiting hazardous behaviour prevention of tobacco use and transition to a non smoking society alcohol abuse prevention abuse of other addictive substances and addiction behaviour moreover the state shall consistently support physical activities improve eating habits and nutrition of the population the state will also contribute to changing social circumstances and improve opportunities for life in a healthy environment support health within communities access to quality foods access to quality water decrease in air pollution

all age groups the state will industry focus its support on sustainable work and healthy ageing it is necessary to consider the future needs of patients working people and workplaces in the context of lifespan increase quality of life healthy lifespan expectancy will improve via improving the development of geriatric medicine i e clinical that deals with health and functioning in old age taking people and society into account diseases predominantly affecting this age group and their treatment and the spa industry including wider use of spa treatments in the context of post operative care and prevention the spa industry will therefore have to be perceived as an interdisciplinary field going beyond the czech republic and the ministry of health of the czech republic since it also provides protection of natural healing sources and protection of spa locations including the adjacent landscape used for treatments healthcare that is generally in order to minimise the impact of social differences on the accessible quality public population s health it is crucial to maintain publicly accessible healthcare in and sufficiently financed sufficient quality and capacity especially in terms of personnel and number of beds in healthcare facilities throughout the territory of the czech republic the essential challenge is sustainability and institutional support of a system for public health protection and support and disease prevention the state shall provide mainly overall and stable institutional support because weakening this system could lead to its causing major impacts not only on the health of citizens but also on total public expenditure for healthcare and the economy of the czech republic in order to improve the quality of life the state wants to gradually increase resources allocated to the healthcare system to the level of advanced states investments into healthcare personnel stabilisation and development including making up for local regional shortcomings in specific are the key in order to have quality healthcare it is necessary to provide a sufficient number of doctors and nurses and other healthcare personnel with consideration given to their ageing and shortage in some areas that is why the state shall strive to increase the number of medical students and motivate them to stay in the czech republic to work after they finish their studies this will be facilitated by keeping the students sufficiently informed throughout their studies and also by a more straightforward system of certifications necessary to practice medicine the state shall also strive to increase the number of university teachers mainly in theoretical fields regarding the length of medical studies we can only expect to see improvement of the current situation after adapting the healthcare the healthcare system must be prepared to face new problems e g system to cope with risks of new infectious diseases increase in resistance to antibiotics or hazardous trends increase in mental illness in society statistical analysis and other possibilities can also be found in significant improvement of innovation process setting in quality and provision of healthcare data and statistics including individual the healthcare system health indicators both as international comparison as well as on national regional and municipal levels procedures are established for the introduction of new technologies into healthcare which provide screening although the spa industry may be related to tourism and hiking it is primarily a form of subsequent treatment not a general field of services such as the hotel industry in the fields where short term trends do not influence hard data hard data is more conclusive in the long term perspective e g some disease prevention and health support fields in such fields it is desirable to also look for so called process indicators use them for assessment and then respond appropriately with political measures strategic framework czech republic of key aspects of application clinical adequacy treatment benefit use effectiveness ethical and socio cultural impact the state shall therefore develop the aforementioned procedures for impact assessment e g health technology assessment creating policies for the field healthcare goes beyond the ministry of health of the czech republic of healthcare and requires participation of all institutions on all levels of public administration not for profit and private sectors scientific and educational institutions communities and individuals themselves all elements of society social groups and individuals must be invited to manage it and make decisions the czech republic shall strengthen public healthcare mainly bodies and institutions of public health protection and support culture culture as a source of we can perceive culture as a sphere of development of creativity and national identity active formation and reflections of society s values it includes social heritage and arts as well as the way of life value systems traditions and beliefs its importance keeps growing in the modern secular democratic state where it becomes a crucial part of national identity formation and preservation that is why the policy of culture is a part of the democracy we live in identity based on culture culture and media policies are responsible for the formation guarantees social cohesion strengthening and preservation of national identity that is based on culture which is a key element of social cohesion and sustainable development culture and arts play an important role in intensifying social resilience against anti democratic tendencies in this context media policy also deserves our attention as independent media of public services play an irreplaceable role in it serving as a point of reference for the population and significantly supporting cultural diversity we also need to pay special attention to support for culture of all national minorities supporting equal access to knowledge of our own culture and awareness of its value together culture with respect for diversity of cultural expression and positive cultural values of foreign cultures and minorities allow us to protect society against negative events e g against the spread of uniformity loss of cultural identity xenophobia or spread of the consumerist society around the world including its negative environmental consequences the state will therefore support development of cultural knowledge and competences across the entire population and reduce inequalities in accessibility to culture using the potential of the internet among other things across society mainly in disadvantaged groups including ethnic minorities ignorance of majority cultural values is one of the obstacles of successful integration of these disadvantaged groups development of culture culture contributes to our quality of life it transforms cities and requires sufficient resources municipalities into pleasant places for life work and travel stimulates education and contributes to life long personal development however it is people and society the main element of identity policy and creativity development we therefore need sufficient public resources to develop it mainly for the purposes of systematic and financial support and decent employee rewards in public private and not for profit institutions in the culture sector state support for culture as a the objective of a culture policy must be to support all current and source of innovation and historical culture that although not necessarily commercially viable is still employment considered as high quality art art also brings about innovation that can be applied outside of its own cultural sector art cultural heritage and its care also represent significant generators of jobs cultural heritage restoration and support for art that requires skilled expertise boosts the employment rate and opportunities for small and medium businesses and creates space for the preservation and restoration of unique procedures and techniques cultural and creative sectors are sources of technological and non technological innovation and they bring value added to the development of other economic sectors their interdisciplinary range also positively influences sustainable development creation and strengthening of social capital development of tourism and an increase in the values of products and services generated in other industries the state s task is also to consider new disciplines from the digital economy and cultural and creative industries in its support of balanced and efficient innovation management since their results go beyond the borders of culture and contribute to the social and economic development of the czech republic equal access to creativity as creativity as a central value of european identity is a part of a fully a prerequisite for adaptability developed human life and therefore the opportunity to develop it must be towards change open to all regardless of social status at the same time it is vital as a source of solutions to the challenge of world change that is ahead of us culture and art accessibility making cultural and artistic values accessible to the public must take take priority over commercial priority over generating financial resources with respect to historical gain development many cultural institutions in the czech republic remain public property the desirable goal is then to provide and actively make cultural values in the public sphere accessible and free of charge wherever possible public creative competitions the main criterion in the field of culture is always its effective as a tool for quality production applying the principle of a public creative competition facilitates improvement such effective production we must establish an environment that provides cooperation between the state local administration and the private sector which is beneficial for all parties cultural policy must also be the state s cultural policy must be interconnected at all public supported on a local level administration levels it is necessary to actively

state s economy material cultural heritage brought to the public has an undeniable positive economic impact in the locality where it contributes to the development of a wide range of services cultural heritage and cultural and creative sectors represent significant job creators boosting local businesses that employ people from the locality promotion of cultural tourism in general raises awareness of a country many tourists head heritage will support tourism to the country for its monuments and live culture we can use our unique cultural identity to build sustainable cultural tourism promotion of the state abroad will intensify by participation in european internationally respected statuses of cultural heritage such as participation in the unesco world heritage list the representative list of unesco s non material cultural heritage unesco s international registry of world heritage and in other european internationally respected tools for cultural heritage support for example european cultural route european heritage label or in european routes of industrial heritage cultural landscape for cultural landscape is a specific cultural value we need to ensure its climate change

favourable to families barriers and social pressures have been family parenthood and marriage are covered by special legal protection and are highly valued in society suitable social economic conditions are important for the good functioning of families they focus on the financial wellbeing of families good work life balance and services of care for children and the elderly therefore these conditions allow people sufficient leisure time to improve their family relationships families with specific needs require special attention targeted measures are taken contributing to equal access to

mitigated access to dignified work is also extended to groups that remain disadvantaged on the labour market i e parents on parental leave people with disabilities and people over years of age the general unemployment rate decreases along with the proportion of long term unemployed in the total unemployment rate the degree of and involuntary flexibility of work is including activities carried out through the platform economy and other new atypical forms of work immigration and integration policies emphasise the attraction of qualified foreigners and intensify the diversity of the workforce which is vital for innovation public policies also support the return of czech citizens from abroad structural inequalities in society are low in the long term perspective the proportion of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion is decreasing income inequality is decreasing and emphasis is placed on maintaining a strong middle layer gender inequality is decreasing equal approach to persons at risk of discrimination based on sex age dependency disability ethnicity nationality sexual orientation religion or worldview is ensured multiple discrimination prevention is particularly emphasised education develops individuals unique potential and ability to manage and influence change and promotes a cohesive sustainable society oriented towards sustainable development the education system is inclusive and mutually permeable it does not divide pupils at a young age into gifted and not gifted and limits the dependence of educational paths and results on students socio economic background the education system encourages teachers and other educators to bring about the necessary changes in education and to assume the role of guides for education participants in a changing world strategic framework czech republic the system is very open to contact with the real world and involves all participants in education education provides everyone with access to the development of transferable competencies needed for active civic professional and personal life the system provides an adequate general foundation necessary for further education engagement in society and for understanding the interdependence of the contemporary world the system of life long education is publicly guaranteed and widely available it focuses on both vocational education and training in transferable skills the health of all population groups is improving the lifespan and health of all czech population groups is improving influences causing inequalities in the field of healthcare are decreasing the public health system is stable generally available in terms of both quality and capacity while developing a corresponding professional structure the average age of both medical and non medical personnel is decreasing and the rewards for all healthcare workers are improving a healthy lifestyle is supported by higher public expenditure with an emphasis on primary disease prevention and health promotion throughout life consumption of addictive substances as well as the load of hazardous harmful substances and noise are reduced by improving the quality of the environment specified limits of harmful substances and noise are not exceeded greater public investment supports key cultural functions and equal access to culture and creativity increased public spending is directed towards culture and the possibilities for long term financial planning of cultural organisations are improved depending on the needs of the changing society the development and establishment of new cultural organisations is systematically supported cultural and creative industries are being promoted as an opportunity for economic development culture workers are supported both systematically and financially to increase their significance and improve the conditions needed for their creative and motivational role towards other groups in society economic model vision the economy of the czech republic is purposefully reducing its material and energy intensity economic institutions deliver long term growth in the economy built on entrepreneurship innovation people s creativity and abilities higher value added industries the circular economy low carbon technologies robotics and and rely on a robust and quality infrastructure it is based on the principles of the social market economy the core of which is cooperation and coordination between the public business and non profit sectors public finances ensure that the resources for the implementation of public policies are spent adequately and efficiently introduction efficient and eco friendly the economy is a sum of creative productive activities that satisfy economy is the goal people s material and non material needs a sustainable economic model ensures the economy s ability to increase the scope and quality of services and goods provided in the most efficient way in the long term perspective while at the same time managing to sustain natural resource requirements within the acceptable limits of the long term production capacity of the country decoupling promoting an efficient and environmentally friendly economic model is the main general objective of this chapter there is more to measure economic success is measured by the material wealth of the success than gdp economy several indicators can be used to measure it gdp is the volume of a national economy s final production gdp per capita is the measure of country economic level there is a correlation between the growth of economic levels per capita and improving quality of life for a small open economy such as the czech republic gross national income gni is also an important indicator this is the volume of income of residents domestic economic entities the difference between gdp and gni shows what proportion of the income created within the economy will remain in it and can therefore serve to further the economy finance public policies consumption investments etc macroeconomic stability is a economic cycles and fluctuations in economic performance can affect prerequisite of economic success in meeting sustainable development objectives therefore the success achievement of this strategic framework objectives must always be assessed considering eventual phase of economic cycle whether the strategic framework czech republic economy is in recession or boom but also macroeconomic stability for this reason gdp gni real household consumption inflation rate and external balance current balance of payments ratio to gdp will always be taken into account when evaluating the success of the cr gdp has limitations as an these indicators have limited reporting value there are a number of indicator alternatives such as the human development index or the index of sustainable economic welfare however quantitative indicators series in particular gdp and gni are very similar to other softer indicators of quality of life and the level of wellbeing as perceived by czech households in their everyday lives therefore we use this standard economic metric the material wealth thus expressed is also an integral part of a broader quality of life assessment within the oecd wellbeing framework convergence to the eu the czech republic is close to the average eu economic level requires a major converging to the original eu gdp per capita which is above the entire transformation of the eu average within years is very ambitious the prerequisite for economy achieving it would be a qualitative jump of the economy to a higher performance level this is only possible if there are significant structural changes accompanied by growth in productivity and value added the necessary structural reforms must link to the five areas specified in detail in the five numbered sections of this chapter economic institutions foreign investments as a the growth of the czech economy has been largely based on growth engine are history external sources on a massive inflow of foreign direct investment fdi however this external source of growth is depleting with fdi opportunities apparently largely saturated this trend illustrates for example the ceased growth of fdi see chart of the development analysis the goal for the next years is to maintain and increase the benefits of fdi and to find and activate fdi independent internal sources of growth the three pillars of economic should czech economy generate sufficient output over a long period policy it is necessary to focus on three tasks support for entrepreneurship direct implementation of pro growth measures focusing on education see research development and innovation including infrastructures and emphasising resource efficiency and reducing the damage caused by the consumption of natural resources these three tasks are addressed further business support must include all business sectors but particularly small and medium enterprises sme as the least developed sector with the highest growth potential the most important thing is to focus on fdi quality growth in the large business sector which forms the backbone of the economy it is necessary to promote quality and international competitiveness of their products the second and third tasks are discussed in sections to improve the quality of foreign the czech republic will strive to improve the quality of fdi of foreign investment companies operating in our country the goal is to achieve the most economic model sophisticated upper levels of international value chains i e those with the highest value added the fdi quality score ex post is represented by labor productivity and wages the ex ante indicator can be the technological intensity of the investment take advantage of the the czech republic will support the development of business with subcontractor position and the highest value added in domestic companies which is partly related to advance to independence the improvement in the quality of fdi but also to investments in research development and innovation exacting demand for by foreign companies operating in the czech republic may be an appropriate impetus and opportunity for domestic enterprises the second part supported more in the long term perspective is the shift from the position of a subcontractor to an independent producer able to apply their own product to the final production market large businesses large businesses form the backbone of the economy their competitive abroad portion of gva is dominant increasing the share of this sector in the production of gva is therefore not so important it is much more important to improve its quality as is the case with fdi the support of large businesses should therefore focus on the ability of large businesses to step up and keep abreast of technical organisational and business developments around the world which requires a significant investment in their own infrastructure and in research development and innovation small and medium smes have the greatest potential to contribute to economic growth enterprises have the greatest because as a sector in the czech republic they are less developed than growth potential the large and micro enterprises although they have approximately the same proportion of workers as the other average eu countries they have a lower share of gva the greatest obstacles to the development of smes need to be removed particularly access to capital should be facilitated and relatively high administrative barriers should be reduced support for smes through one of the elements of support for smes is also the support of a social entrepreneurship participatory economy which includes social entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship through employee participation or cooperatives this type of business can effectively combine profitability with social inclusion and democratic decision making systems it also facilitates the financing of start ups or the transfer of ownership of pre existing businesses so called succession the adoption or non the shape and performance of the czech economy in the next adoption of the euro will years are closely related to whether we will adopt the euro or not adopting affect the performance and the euro will have both economic and political consequences from the shape of the czech economy economic point of view the euro brings advantages in particular lower transaction costs as well as disadvantages in particular the loss of our own monetary policy which allows for coping with economic shocks through our own currency instruments including the floating exchange rate in addition to fulfilling the relevant formal criteria in the czech republic and the consent of the eurozone countries any decision on admission includes strategic framework czech republic a prerequisite of the admission being economically viable in the long term perspective so that its benefits outweigh its costs in addition the eurozone itself which is currently facing a number of internal problems should be internally consolidated and its long term functioning clarified on the other hand the czech republic should reach a reasonable level of competitiveness in the eu internal market before adopting the euro which will lose its ability to be strengthened by exchange rate depreciation once it is adopted follow the continental model most indicators show the economic model of the czech republic of the economy stands between the liberal anglo saxon model and the coordinated continental model however it does not take full advantage of either in order to improve the growth and convergence potential of the czech republic s economy financing the r d education and training system and management and industrial relations must be changed to avoid the necessity for long term systematic and unilateral transfers e g know how or capital from abroad the structure and advantages of the central european region and the tradition of large industrial enterprises in bohemia and moravia correspond rather to the coordinated model of the economy which developed most in germany changing domestic economic institutions towards this model should not be mechanical but should take into account domestic and current trends research development and innovation link research education and innovation is an improvement in a product or service it is often result business together of r d a precondition for a greater degree of innovation is the effective link between research organisations high quality education and businesses it is necessary to restore and support the institutional base of applied research and to streamline dissemination and sharing of knowledge originated in research organisations with an emphasis on their subsequent application in practice the ability to innovate is the the ability to innovate on the basis of r d is a necessary condition key to achieving a long term for raising the standard of living our ability to respond to society s expected efficient economy needs and global challenges also depends on mastering innovation an integral part of this process is to support education for innovation and to support the development of an environment where intellectual property and know how have their social and economic value actually for example there is a need to implement a range of climate change related measures such as the transition to a low carbon circular economy and the reduction of energy intensity mitigation and the restraint of its negative effects on society and the environment adaptation only an innovating economy is able to absorb and acquire new technologies and ways of corporate organisation and capitalise on them for more details see og cr anal za economic model strengthen the innovation the czech economy can absorb new technologies and processes potential of domestic which have been developed elsewhere similarly with the overall strong enterprises position of foreign companies operating in the czech republic it is actually both foreign and large enterprises which push applied r d forward the segment of research and technology oriented small and medium enterprises is relatively undeveloped there is a need to encourage companies that do not yet invest and do not do any r d or buy their results to start their own r d activities or to encourage them to cooperate with research organisations including universities the aim is to ensure the shift of smes towards value chain positions with higher value added the ability to sell their products and services at a higher price supporting smes research and innovation activities with the help of appropriate yet minimally expanded support tools responding quickly to market demands is another step in supporting this segment entry to new markets is also often the impetus for innovation however the rate of of smes is low in the czech republic in the long term perspective and should therefore be more pronounced in the future as well as increasing sme participation in international programmes in the context of a frequent enterprise strategy for adopting and adapting technologies from abroad it is also important to place an emphasis on introducing higher order innovations the higher the order of innovation the more significant the change of process or product promote business use of the challenge for the future in addition to innovation itself is the domestic innovations ability of businesses to capitalise on innovation and to create a whole value chain on its base businesses need to discover but also use and sell the new solution discovered in our country so that most of the value added remains in the domestic economy the key task of the state is to support the establishment of between research sme sector and to streamline and accelerate the commercialisation of research results thus strengthening the inadequate institutional basis for applied research resources management efficiency of resource sustainability productivity and ultimately the very sophistication of the consumption is desirable economy is reflected in the ability to manage resources especially feature of the economy effectiveness of reusing and recycling the most important resources for the czech economy are fuels and other mineral resources soil water and clean air another important parameter of resource consumption is greenhouse gas emissions especially carbon dioxide pollutants and waste production it is beneficial to take use of resources is linked to externalities or external costs and externalities into account benefits externalities are only partially included in the price of resources og cr n politika v v a esk na l ta strategic framework czech republic therefore the society uses resources more or conversely less than what is their corresponding social value both czech and european legislation is trying to remedy this in varying degrees and via various instruments a balanced combination of different approaches should enable taking externalities into account e g expressing the value and compensation of ecosystem services see section and the specific objective i e compensation to suppliers of these services or taxes or limits on resource consumption which harms the environment public health or overloads the infrastructure the czech republic and its the czech republic as a european state is part of the geopolitical surroundings are not self space that consumes more raw materials than it produces more than three sufficient quarters of metal ores two thirds of fossil fuels and practically all phosphorus consumed in the eu come from non eu countries and our own i e eu fossil fuel production is declining rapidly it does not necessarily have to be negative in itself manufacturing creates higher value added than the mining industry and is more sophisticated despite this rising resource consumption in emerging economies can put europe in a weaker strategic position the state will therefore work with other eu members on legislation tax incentives and other rules to ensure increased circulation of raw materials in the economy it focuses on reducing raw materials extending product life and decreasing wasteful behaviour the circular economy is one an important part of such a solution is better use of domestic of the solutions to the limited resources replacing natural materials with recycling waste and secondary availability of resources raw materials the state supports the waste management hierarchy where waste prevention is preferred over recycling recycling over energy recovery and energy recovery of waste over waste disposal in summary such an approach is referred to as a circular economy a necessary condition and part of the support of the circular economy is also building a relevant environmental service infrastructure water becomes a strategic the czech economy will have to respond at all levels to the ongoing resource changes and associated extreme meteorological phenomena particularly drought and water scarcity floods torrential rains and heatwaves another serious problem is the inability of landscape to retain water see section czech agriculture forestry and water management await a fundamental change facing the need for adaptation to the expected changes in the landscape water regime it is also necessary to prepare conditions for recycling collection and utilisation of rainwater and to control run off from paved areas in urban water management systems eurostat dataset material flow accounts eurostat online for more information see moe cr strategie p soben se zm n v nk ch r chapter water regime in the landscape and water management economic model soil is an integral part of most of the czech land is used by agricultural and forestry ecosystem services and an businesses especially in agriculture there is an imbalance between short irreplaceable source of food term market incentives and long term economic prospects enterprises production adapt their production to market conditions and subsidies the state will gradually change the incentives and rules to encourage agriculture and forestry to make better use of the land another dimension of efficient land use is food production it is desirable that consumption of foods that we can produce in our country is adequately covered by domestic sources that is to say it is desirable that the czech republic is reasonably self sufficient by this will not only help to maintain the know how and the level of equipment but it will also improve the condition of agricultural land see section encourage employment in the countryside and reduce the negative external costs of over importing food more efficient use of energy the czech republic will systematically strive for an economically and reduction of greenhouse viable improvement in energy efficiency at the same time it will gas emissions systematically reduce greenhouse gas emissions absolute and relative to the volume of production in line with international european and national economic strategies to achieve both a combination of different resources will be needed this will include a more effective setting of the emissions trading system starting in an analysis of the options for introducing environmental elements in consumer and energy tax rates for fuels consumed in non ets installations building insulation support use of secondary energy sources wider deployment of emission free and low emission vehicles etc in the energy industry this will induce a demand for reducing fossil fuel consumption this can be achieved in several ways including increasing the share of renewable or nuclear energy production or from waste and by improving energy efficiency even in the case of new sources account must be taken of the externalities they cause by means such as the departure from first generation biofuels etc coal reserves as the only significant source of fossil fuel in the czech republic should remain a reserve source the mix of energy resources any solution to the transformation of energy resource supply in the must be resilient competitive czech republic must meet the following conditions resilience i e and sustainable in the long security of supply both in normal operation and with sudden changes of term perspective external conditions competitiveness i e energy prices for businesses comparable to those of foreign countries and households without the threat of energy poverty long term sustainability in the sense that the structure and function of energy does not compromise the emphasis on environmental and climate protection the sector is financially and economically stable so businesses can secure the necessary investment in restoration and development and last but not least sufficient primary resources are provided strategic framework czech republic infrastructure securing critical infrastructure allows people goods services and information to infrastructure is the first travel infrastructure the disruption or malfunctioning of which would have condition for infrastructure a serious impact on state security on security of the population s basic development living needs on the health of the people or on the state economy is called critical infrastructure this concept emphasizes the safety it relates to technical and organisational parameters of infrastructure which then affect its resilience and flexibility both of these properties are important the safety of the population depends on them in cooperation with operators of critical infrastructure elements a critical infrastructure protection system is being developed to address prevention a state of readiness and resolving consequences and impacts of failures of critical infrastructure elements on the lives and health of the population securing their basic living needs and also impacts on the economy sustainability of critical infrastructure is determined by the costs of its maintenance and improvement of resilience both public and or private policy induced expenses a comprehensive definition of obligations of operators and crisis management bodies in the event of crisis and the extent and structure of threats natural foreign etc strategic infrastructure is however the way infrastructure contributes to the performance of the important for the economic economy in the long term perspective is important for us the main types of model so called strategic infrastructures are energy electricity system and heat supply system gas pipelines oil pipelines and product pipelines transport road and rail network air transport infrastructure waterways and combined transport water management supply of drinking water drainage and waste water treatment telecommunication and digital network strategic infrastructure is sustainable provided by the ability to deliver services of general economic interest in a sufficient way at an affordable price using economically efficient systems with full cost coverage by users including some positive externalities in revenues its sustainability also depends on the structure and interaction of network industries operating the infrastructure public and induced private costs for its recovery changes in terms of demand and technological innovations in the field of network services infrastructure is measured by the condition of a resilient economy business and quality of life is the quality of its services based on a well designed high quality and reliable infrastructure in good condition that is designed with sufficient reserves it contributes to the smooth functioning of other industries in addition it provides resilience against crises caused by humans or nature the success of building and managing an infrastructure relates to the quality of services it provides therefore the state wants to support the continuous improvement of the quality of infrastructure services further development and strengthening of the infrastructure must ensure that it produces as little damage as possible act no coll on crisis management and on amendments to certain acts letter g economic model such as fragmentation of land or soil occupation the standard of sustainable infrastructure network services relates to their accessibility continuity security and accessibility including an acceptable non inhibiting price local conditions user income consumer standards and an alternative and individual share of service provision therefore affect maximum benefit infrastructure operation high quality infrastructure is strategically important to the state needs regulation without systematic and long term investments with a significant public share there may be risk of water energy or transport services being compromised thus disrupting the basic functioning of the state infrastructure management operation and maintenance cannot usually be left to short term decision making based on a market mechanism the focus of possible disparities shifts from security and qualitative factors to economic and social factors the state should therefore set maintain and improve the regulatory framework in a consistent manner to ensure the long term functionality and resilience of the infrastructure as well as the high standard and the social effectiveness of its services the electricity network must an electricity network is an important part of the energy infrastructure be ready for in this we are referring to its transmission and distribution aspects not the source its concept is based on the traditional of production into large power plants the emergence of small energy sources such as solar panels on roofs municipal wind farms or biogas stations will primarily require a qualitative adaptation of this network the state is planning a gradual investment into infrastructure heat supply systems will thermal energy supply systems represent the energy infrastructure contribute to the that is essential for the efficient use of heat from renewable and secondary and sources of energy that are difficult or impossible to obtain efficiently and localisation of production used separately at the level of individual buildings less valuable biomass especially in biogas derived from geothermal energy waste heat from industrial processes etc the use of locally available heat sources contributes to the of energy reduces dependence on fossil fuel imports and strengthens the local economy the czech republic has a developed heating system that needs to be gradually transformed for the use of low carbon energy sources including energy from secondary sources and waste heat and their transportation to consumers especially in urban a good connection with the the czech republic must not become the inner periphery of europe economic core of europe is a it is therefore necessary to ensure quality and efficient transport prerequisite for the success connections between all regions of the czech republic within the trans of the czech economy european transport networks to all neighbouring states so that transport is not a limiting factor of import and export preventing the economic development of all regions of the czech republic however steps should mit cr n ak n pl n pro s t strategic framework czech republic be taken not to increase the volume of transit road freight transport significantly given the high externalities associated with its operation in the area of rail transport on the other hand the role of railway infrastructure in terms of transit should be intensified both by rail freight corridors and by building high speed railways it is also necessary to reduce the administrative burden created by the construction and technology approval process deficiencies in transport another part of the transport infrastructure is regional communication infrastructure must not all regions of the czech republic show great deficiencies in the quality of restrict the development of transport infrastructure which limits the economic potential of the regions the regions and as a result the ability to reduce regional inequalities see section this is also a weakness in view of the expected increase in mobility requirements of the population see section it is therefore important to reduce the differences in transport infrastructure quality across regions support lagging regions by technological changes in the global world increase economic developing information differences rich and innovative parts of the world states urban infrastructure are able to adapt to these transformations better than middle income areas and therefore the state wants to invest in the information infrastructure in the peripheral parts of the czech republic where jobs disappear public services are deteriorating and people are leaving see municipalities and regions the emphasis on water the water industry infrastructure must supply municipalities and management is related to towns reliably with drinking water and effectively drain and clean waste water becoming a strategic water despite the long term deterioration of conditions this is resource pre conditioned by improving resistance of water sources against contamination and at the same time to substantially improve the quality of discharged cleaned water into to ensure a lasting opportunity for life of aquatic fauna and flora in a natural environment for more information see resistant ecosystems another supporting step is the improvement of the technical parameters of the water management infrastructure in particular the improvement of the hydraulic effectiveness of the drinking water distribution systems and their systematic restoration ensuring long term sustainability and the construction of new multipurpose water reservoirs as a minimum consider increasing state owners must provide sufficient investment to ensure that the water influence on water management infrastructure continues to deliver its services to the highest infrastructure to ensure standard it must be able to mitigate the consequences of drought related sufficient investment to climate change upon expiration of lease contracts with foreign partners the state should consider taking steps to regain responsibility for the operation of the water supply infrastructure at all levels in the czech republic s competence and administration or identifying possible tools for regulating the integration of owners this measure can achieve a significant increase in investment in the coming decades economic model public finance system public finances are a tool for fiscal policy is one of the instruments of economic policy primarily implementing public policies carried out by the government it uses the budgets of public institutions in particular the state budget and state funds that affect the monetary relations between the state and other economic entities in particular the state uses fiscal policy to implement its plans to promote economic growth reduce social disparities budget funds or as incentives to reduce unnecessary consumption e g tobacco or alcohol or invest in r d the role of fiscal policy in macroeconomic stabilisation is equally important however its long term sustainability is a necessary condition the three pillars of public sustainability of public finances must be based on three well finance balanced pillars the quality of public expenditure money spent must match the results achieved an acceptable and yet sustainable structure and level of tax revenue from a social point of view it must tax different population groups fairly and take account of demographics economic not limit economic activity or administrative effective choice low administration of taxes a flexible balance of income and expenditure which will be balanced in the long term perspective without a structural deficit and counter cyclical allowing for example investment in the recession to offset the economic downturn politically determined deciding what public funds are used for and where they come from is expenditure must be spent a political decision effectiveness of public spending should be reflected by as efficiently as possible the long term universal success rate i e measuring the success of public policy and expenditure even with international comparisons other instruments include external auditing of public budgets adherence to the e principle economy efficiency and effectiveness strengthening of good central purchasing practice or emphasis on open data the tax system can be the czech republic needs to streamline its tax system there is streamlined by useful guidance for this process in the form of repeated recommendations some of its parameters from the world bank the international monetary fund the oecd and the european union which highlight a relatively low current tax burden an excessive tax burden on labour a lower than average capital and asset burden and a disproportionately long time for tax administration companies also legitimately call for more predictable tax rules in order to improve the effectiveness of corporate tax collection the strengthening of european and international cooperation including the reduction of the role of tax havens should also be promoted the sustainability criterion of the public finance system must prepare for the impact of the tax system is to ensure ageing technological leaps growing inequalities and climate change in sufficient income under addition to changes in terms of expenditure a change in the tax mix changing conditions income taxes environmental taxes property taxes indirect taxes etc strategic framework czech republic could be a response to these trends in some cases these may not necessarily entail higher rates but more efficient choices public finances must be european funds have strengthened the czech economy helped to prepared for a possible revitalise cities and towns and to revitalise the countryside we must be reduction in the european careful to adhere to the principle of to avoid displacement of funds revenue national resources and to make public policies and the normal operation of the state dependent on eu funds their inflow into the czech republic will gradually decline the emerging dependence may undermine the fulfilment of the tasks that have eventually been successfully funded the state should therefore prepare public budgets to counteract the future decline meanwhile it is necessary to consider concentrating the funds on investments to increase the growth potential of the czech economy innovative financial instruments can also be used as available risk capital for investment into small and medium enterprises changes in the public all changes to the fiscal system must respect the principle of finance system must not solidarity and justice the same tax can have a different impact on different compromise social peace social groups when using taxes instead of expenditure for direct implementation of policies it is necessary to consider which groups can achieve tax benefits the state must also subject the same tax considerations to existing tax bonus malus setting strategic objectives the economy grows in long term and the domestic sector is strong domestic

quality of foreign direct investment in the czech republic improves the czech republic has well functioning and stable institutions to support applied research and development and to identify opportunities in this area the czech republic has a stable material and human capacity for r d with the appropriate structure and direction in which both the state and businesses invest sufficient

etc resilient ecosystems vision agriculture forestry and water management respect natural limits and global climate change they improve soil quality slow water drainage from the landscape and help maintain biodiversity the development of settlements and technical infrastructure especially transport infrastructure takes place with the utmost regard to maintaining and strengthening ecosystem services provided by landscape introduction our landscape has changed the structure of the czech landscape underwent a significant change dramatically over the last in the second half of the last century efforts to rapidly increase agricultural century mostly for the productivity regardless of other landscape functions led to rapid water worse drainage increased water and wind erosion extensive soil degradation and a significant reduction in biodiversity and overall landscape uniformity we can compensate for the advancing climate change will mainly bring changes in rainfall fluctuation of precipitation by distribution there will be less snow as well as periods of mild longer slowing water drainage lasting rain on the contrary there will also be torrential precipitation and periods slowing water discharge from the landscape by improving its ability to withhold precipitation is therefore vital to us climate change in the unless compensated by improved landscape structure and more landscape will gradually appropriate farming practices climate change will also lead to further soil force major changes degradation and the extinction of some biological species change must be gradual and long term but fundamental and permanent due to ongoing climate change these changes are indispensable unquestionably demanding but manageable landscape and ecosystem services the country needs the the current czech landscape contains both valuable parts that need principles of long term to be protected and degraded parts the gradual change of which needs to restoration and creation be decided see development analysis spatial planning is of crucial importance for decision making in terms of the landscape so it is necessary to create conditions for the creation and use of specific spatial planning documents aimed at sustainable use management and landscape planning as well as protection of its natural and cultural values the creation of a landscape policy in public debate and the definition of strategic framework czech republic instruments for its implementation form a suitable framework for this process the country s policy will in a broader context than in the current spatial planning deal with the assessment of the landscape s current state and will propose the principles of its long term restoration and creation in situations where there are fundamental changes in the landscape the decline of intensive agriculture on less fertile soils development analysis municipalities and regions and the landscape burdened by other intensive uses and on the other hand the demand for ecosystem services landscape policy will be the basis for other forms and levels of planning strategic and spatial planning catchment area planning complex landscaping etc subsidies can motivate the structure of the czech landscape was shaped mainly by farmers to sustainable agriculture the conditions of subsidy support see development give the czech state the possibility of reducing the negative impacts of agriculture on the landscape within the limits given by the respective common eu legislation therefore the state will use a system of european and national support to permanently strengthen ecosystem services and achieve appropriate level of food self sufficiency economic model the provision of subsidies will be linked to improving soil fertility increasing the capacity of the landscape to retain water and restore biodiversity the landscape must be at the same time it is necessary to maintain and progressively permeable again improve the of the landscape for wildlife see development analysis in particular by protecting important migration corridors from placing new barriers and make existing obstacles in these corridors permeable in the case of placing new linear structures in these corridors it is necessary to design the crossing sites to be as permeable for the purposes of wildlife migration as possible accelerating the complex efforts to improve the landscape condition will also include creation or landscaping will be restoration of pathways to make the landscape accessible to people again necessary to improve the see development analysis and planting associated elements such as tree landscape alleys that will help to improve landscape diversity refer to the following it will be necessary to accelerate complex landscaping including landscape features implemented within the so called shared facilities biodiversity we only have a few decades the goal of the czech republic for the next few decades is to left to restore the landscape achieve the presence of viable genetically diverse populations of diversity indigenous species in our landscape to reach this it is necessary to achieve the individual natural habitats in a sufficient range and quality through a well established restoration this plan also features leaving a portion of contiguous areas with preserved wildlife to spontaneous natural development resilient ecosystems some of the abandoned in the countryside there are abandoned areas and they keep areas will be left to emerging they were previously used for agriculture mining industry spontaneous development transport or defence where appropriate some of the abandoned areas will be left to spontaneous development based on natural processes protection of natural processes together with protection of habitats and species is the third pillar of biodiversity protection furthermore it will be necessary to limit the spread of existing invasive species and to prevent or reduce the spread of new invasive species see development analysis it is necessary to increase the conditions for making greener direct payments to farmers under the proportion of landscape the common agricultural policy have so far had a dubious impact on the features and the number of biodiversity of the czech republic as well as of other member states the crops grown real value added can only be the obligation to grow more crops combined with the limitation of the maximum size of a single area that can be planted by a single crop substantial improvements can then bring a relevant share of landscape features in ecological focus areas see development analysis water in the landscape lack of water can lead to expected changes in the distribution of precipitation during the year restrictions on some may cause local water scarcity leading to restrictions placed on consumers consumers see development analysis which may lead to conflict with an interest in the protection of aquatic ecosystems to compensate for if we want to mitigate the consequences of extremes precipitation fluctuation we reduce the release of nutrients from fields into reservoirs and must slow down the drainage groundwater or more specifically to accelerate degradation of these of water nutrients in the aquatic environment it will be necessary to accompany the restoration of themselves river wetlands and other water reservoirs by further long term measures throughout the entire catchment area therefore the following on soil care is devoted to other measures affecting the water regime in the landscape it will be necessary to review revision of the status functionality and justification of drainage the necessity and condition systems will improve the water regime in the landscape as well as the of drainage systems effectiveness of agriculture considering the needs of the site parts of these systems are designed and implemented inappropriately and will need to be eliminated typically these are cases of unnecessarily high levels of drainage from extensively used locations the remaining parts of these often large scale systems will have to undergo a gradual reconstruction

regard to pesticides themselves the previously accepted objective is to reduce the area of bodies of groundwater or more specifically the number of surface water bodies that have exceeded environmental quality limits due to the presence of pesticide residues encouraging organic farming and the more precise use of pesticides in particular choosing the least hazardous product to meet the intended purpose and using it in the right amount at the right time at the right place for example within integrated agricultural production will not only contribute to achieving the goal set out in the previous sentence but it will also help to improve soil and biodiversity in the czech landscape soil care little fertile arable land for soils at all altitudes which due to their properties such as should be transferred to low depth considerable damage or location on a steep slope other uses can no longer be used as arable land it is necessary not only to continue in their grassing and but also to support their conversion to wetlands and other suitable natural features this will dramatically improve the resistance of such soils to erosion and lead to increased carbon storage and improved water regime it will also improve the diversity of landscape features biodiversity to reduce erosion we will in order to slow the erosion of arable land see development need to return dividing analysis we will need to return dividing features into the agricultural features into the landscape landscape using trees shrubs and permanent grasslands to divide the existing blocks of arable land into smaller units at the same time suitable habitats are created for some species of plants and animals see biodiversity in the case of soil endangerment by wind erosion dividing features with orientation and structure acting as are preferable it is necessary to limit the on sloping land where the erosion risk level does not require cultivation of maize potatoes unconditional physical of existing blocks of arable land into and beets on sloping land smaller plots it will be necessary to avoid growing crops that provide very little protection of soil against erosion these include maize potatoes and sugar beet on all arable land it will be necessary to keep to a minimum the cultivation practices that leave the soil surface uncovered by growth and thus significantly prone to erosion permeable surfaces reduce to reduce the erosion of forest soils it is preferable to use permeable drainage concentration surfaces when establishing forest paths and equipping them with a sufficient number of capacity to avoid too much drainage accumulation in trenches see development analysis ma cr n ak n pl n ke sn en pou v n v esk resilient ecosystems sufficient organic matter a sufficient proportion of its organic component improves the soil s improves soil resistance resistance to erosion the organic part is also essential to maintain soil fertility to slow water drainage and to carbon capture and storage from the atmosphere in the case of both agricultural and forest soils it is therefore necessary to keep sufficient post harvest logging residues on the spot to plough a sufficient amount of organic into the arable land and to improve gradually the selective and forestry methods on the forest soil as they do not lead to the rapid decomposition of humus and consequently to acidification of the soil the use of crop rotation with the representation of perennial forage crops e g clover and alfalfa also helps prevent acidification and of agricultural land forest stability can be the shift towards natural species and natural age and spatial improved with trees structure of forest stands development analysis and more considerate appropriate for the given

landscape policy and the rules for its implementation have been processed which the different levels of public administration use in their decision making process the share of arable land is decreasing and the share of permanent grasslands in the agricultural land stock is growing the share of arable land managed under the organic farming regime has been increasing significantly the share

regions improves spatial cohesion directs the trend and limits forced mobility cities and towns create for maintaining and improving the quality of life of their population competent public administration communicates openly with citizens and integrates them systematically into decision making and planning housing is adapted to climate change introduction maintain the the czech republic must find and maintain a balance between the character of the territory role of large cities as poles of growth at a european level and a balanced development that preserves the nature of the territory at all levels this is the only way to ensure that everyone has an adequate quality of life with the freedom to choose the environment in which they want to reside and live make suburbia sustainable the division of the country into metropolitan and peripheral areas will probably continue to increase the trend will not disappear in the near future but the character of urbanisation will change the main challenge therefore lies in limiting the pace of making both the existing and emerging suburbs sustainable and functional and reducing the accompanying negative phenomena such as the increase in commuting and increased traffic load with all its negative effects noise pollutants and growing inequalities between different parts of the republic strengthen cross border in order to maintain the historically established settlement links and internal peripherals structure it is necessary to strengthen cross border links more than anything else it was the isolation of the border regions in the second half of the th century that caused their transformation in the periphery it is therefore necessary to build infrastructure and promote economic maier k development in the regional development policy of the czech republic urban research practice pp strategic framework czech republic development so that both cities and municipalities on both sides of the border form a functional whole the same applies to internal peripherals survival and growing spatial mobility will also so far has been threatened mainly by regional affect smaller towns centres but smaller cities are also likely to be affected it will bear the costs of infrastructure and transport services that will be lacking during the development of the core city and at the same time will endanger the non production function of the suburban landscape based on the experience of cities in western and northern europe it can be expected that some public and commercial services will shift to the suburban space the phenomenon indicating however commercial amenities shops or services are mostly will be the concentrated in larger centres and complexes on the contrary small local concentration of services establishments that have served small municipalities or local parts in cities are disappearing the trend mainly affects the elderly and the socially weaker households that may find it physically or financially difficult to travel for purchases excessive concentrations of out of town activities also result in urban functions moving out from historic city centres thus contributing to the degradation of public space in the physical and philosophical sense of the word if the territorial public administration wants to face this trend it cannot do so without purposeful and effective regulation of spatial plans and without investment from public budgets a key role is played by a state that can support small and medium businesses including services shrinking cities will need to cities that economically active residents are leaving are called adapt to socio demographic shrinking cities this is a negative process which is reflected in the changes degradation of the physical part of the city the reduction of budget revenues and inefficient use of services at the same time it has a negative effect on the attractiveness of the city for example for investors although this trend has not been as significant in the czech republic as in other european regions it is a trend that cannot be avoided almost one sixth of cities are already shrinking this situation raises new demands for the management of affected cities responding only to enhancing economic performance is insufficient in addition to the new approach to spatial planning local authorities and the state must also modify management improve and prepare public services they must be prepared for the new trend and not leave the cities to change based on ad hoc decisions planning at the level of the multilateral development of cities capable of directing the functional units trend also requires better national and regional strategic planning including mutual communication between national

of urban shrinkage in cities of post socialist europe urban research practice municipalities and regions economic social and environmental links between cities their backgrounds and the countryside the state therefore will support the coordination of planning at a level lower than a region and beyond the territory of one municipality characterised by the strong relationship people have with their place of work and home life in their locality i e support shared co ordination of cities and surrounding municipalities re urbanisation and the use is not the only trend alongside it is also possible to of the existing urban expect further changes especially the revival of the core towns that are or structure should be will become centres of functional areas re urbanisation which encouraged is an alternative to the extensive urban growth can encourage the use of existing urban structures and so called brownfield sites abandoned industrial sites however it remains in the public interest to prevent their occurrence standards for public planning the development of lively and cohesive cities cannot be achieved are a prerequisite for a without adequate and affordable housing without addressing the causes of balanced and inclusive discrimination and inequalities e g families with children or multiple development generation families in the housing market and without eliminating social exclusion and homelessness in terms of both spatial and strategic planning standards of availability of public services in municipalities must therefore be developed according to their type and size spatial and strategic planning must also ensure the protection of cultural and natural heritage cities must adapt to population ageing also makes its demands on cities and public demographic change services this change requires that most of the dwellings public spaces and amenities in cities and their structures be accessible permeable and friendly to all ages and user groups the local administration which plans and implements investments in streets squares parks and buildings plays a very important role in this foreigners can also be the population composition will also change especially in the cities integrated using appropriate the first wave of immigrants from other countries have settled in large cities urban solutions in particular and did not create closed ethnic or religious enclaves in the coming years some of them or their descendants will probably move to other places in the country and also commute for work it will be necessary to promote the integration of foreigners into society in the full range of activities carried out by regional centres to support the integration of foreigners social and legal counselling socio cultural courses and czech language courses technological innovation in urban development cities and municipalities must seek to combine must not compromise city technological innovation in particular so called integrated solutions identity transport energy architecture communication and green technologies however the overall effectiveness of the urban system such as the smart cities concept must not be at the expense of preserving the identity of other buildings public spaces culture and everyday life planning at the local level must therefore also promote social cohesion and create living strategic framework czech republic communities and viable cities support for the smart cities concept should be heading for this objective technological change is significant but social innovation and innovation are often more important restriction of forced mobility cities and regions are exposed to a growing mobility trend is in the public interest commuting for work or education is necessary due to job opportunities and schools but also services being located away from the home it is in the public interest to reduce this imbalance and to promote qualified job opportunities where they are missing this will reduce the demand for transport and therefore energy and economic costs and will support the preservation of the settlement structure and the balanced use of the landscape restricting forced mobility allows people to make free choices where they want to live work and spend leisure time does not have to pressure on labour migration and the production of externalities reduce mobility particularly from passenger car traffic can mitigate the of industry and services as well as the development of telecommunication and information technology which allows many entrepreneurs and workers to work from home internet shopping which has grown significantly over the last decade only between and the percentage of online shoppers has grown from to also brings an increase in the supply of goods and services as well as time and cost savings however as experience from other countries shows the other side of and of the world as well as the personalisation of work services may also bring an increase in mobility especially with regard to the long term growth of e commerce internet shopping and subsequent delivery and the gradual forcing of commercial infrastructures away from areas showing symptoms of maintaining available and quality postal services cannot be achieved without the multi purpose use of post offices which in addition to postal services can serve as a public administration contact point as well as service providers mobility will also be related to people are likely to move more in various stages of their lives in this life cycle phases respect czech families are beginning to follow the trends of western european countries the elderly tend to leave the cities and seek a more peaceful environment in their own country or abroad where they are close to nature and necessary services recreation and seasonal housing in summer houses and cottages will therefore be less popular than ever before in the coming years example is provided in the study van

is the temporary location of the owner or users who use this object primarily for recreational purposes quote d second housing in municipalities and regions factors that will affect all of these types of mobility will probably increase but the places mobility where the people come from and go to can change they can also move back home to the countryside or to another country if they accumulate capital retire or lose their jobs mobility will affect energy prices political stability availability of housing in places offering work and services in small towns or in the countryside regional inequalities cities will continue to grow if the growth is driven by and probably will remain driven by large cities they avoid threatening their or settlement of closely interconnected medium and small spatial and social cohesion towns they are usually more productive with their gains increasing in size they also strengthen the growth in their vicinity at the same time smaller towns can prosper from their proximity to neighbouring cities even at the level of public service sharing see paragraph which compensates for their small size however urban development must not be at the expense of spatial and social cohesion nor should the disparities between them and the country be negatively affected therefore municipalities must carefully consider the construction of new commercial industrial and business premises and buildings during strategic and spatial planning in such a way that they do not contribute to the excessive degradation of traditional centre functions and avoid a concentration of services and work on the outskirts of the city these processes reinforce differences in quality of life especially for the ageing and socially weak members of society an appropriate tool to prevent these negative phenomena is the above mentioned planning at a level lower than the region and beyond the territory of a single municipality allowing for the character of the state and its regions social inequalities need to be the state wants to put functioning national strategies in place that reduced through integrated respond to the identified needs of the area in a timely manner and focus on strategies to solve the measures that support regions cities and municipalities in addressing problem on the spot social disparities in their territory the state will provide systematic support to regions and municipalities and will provide mechanisms for the transfer of information between national regional and local levels in addressing social integration and inclusion in housing education employment health setting up social services solving excess debt as well as in other areas the basis for the successful management of social inequalities is the simple and balanced accessibility of the service functions their balanced distribution throughout the state and the solution of the problems at their place of origin prevention which is focused on particular people and households must go hand in hand with solutions that revive peripheral regions rural communities or parts of cities in terms of the economy and provide the same standard of public services as in the prosperous parts of the czech republic in bla kov t d matou ek v eds individu ln a v velk ch industri ln ch m st v pp oecd oecd czech republic strategic framework czech republic the country in the case of economically problematic regions according to the definition of the regional development strategy emphasis will be placed on their systematic support and economic restructuring there is a need to promote the state will focus on targeted and greater support for the creation of entrepreneurship using and highly skilled jobs especially in those areas where the economic recovery strengthening local is yet to be successful it also wants to strengthen the performance and resources capacity of regions cities and municipalities in charge of development programmes it is especially desirable to promote the creation of highly qualified job roles in small and medium enterprises using local potential promoting affordable rental not all internal migration is due to work but for cheaper and housing prevents the affordable housing socially weak families are moving from socially emergence of socially excluded localities to cities rural areas and peripheral parts of the country excluded enclaves the state will therefore support the diverse forms of housing in all parts of cities and regions especially rental housing for all segments of society for life in cities and municipalities the emphasis on prevention and gradual transformation of segregated and socially excluded homes streets and districts is important just as regulations should prevent the emergence of closed gated communities at the opposite end of the social ladder increase the importance of non state participants and community development involving all participants in major companies have frequently been one of the main counterparts decision making of the public administration in the decision making process concerning governance at all levels spatial planning the public administration partner in decision making even the lowest levels should primarily be the public in a broad sense local citizens citizens initiatives associations and not for profit organisations small entrepreneurs or special purpose associations of municipalities solutions should arise in the spirit of public administration and investor cooperation with this public avoiding conflicts challenging decisions and using remedies planning becomes more robust and more conceptual a critical point may be the year when funding from europe which now supports equal representation and partnership building is likely to drop sharply fulfilling the partnership principle however must respect the responsibility of the public administration for the final decision an undesirable alternative to partner development is the increase in the importance of legal conflicts of non state participants in the form of more frequent use of all legal means petitions administrative proceedings court proceedings which may increase the conflicts of the planning and decision making processes strategic planning and public administration at all levels must learn how to stir up an ongoing governance should involve public debate and moderate it it should prepare and create a space where all participants and use all various participants businesses local citizens and others can jointly instruments to do so participate in strategic planning and governance discuss land use and specific structures seek consensus and compromise this discussion must also lead to practical results and ultimately in the public s interest because it is the public administration that bears the greatest responsibility for the municipalities and regions implementation of the agreed intentions however the constructive approach of companies citizens and not for profit organisations and their willingness to accept at least moral responsibility for failure i e the ability to accept change and continue to cooperate is a condition the state will therefore strive to develop and promote tools enhancing participation in particular ma and integrated rural development tools clld itis and regional centres which also require a consensus of partners from the public private and not for profit sectors an alternative to cities to which integrated tools do not apply may be the community supported development linked to ma in the future cooperation between rural and urban lags can strengthen social cohesion and help solve urban and rural with and climate change enhanced participation and through effective participation and involvement of all participants the community life state will support the development of local communities at different levels municipalities city districts or the whole region support will be based on trust partnership and networking as they strengthen each other the community is a group of inhabitants the unorganised public living in a shared territory consistently perceived as their neighbourhood participating in self government and respecting the constitutional and legal framework of the czech republic a prerequisite for the functioning of a resilient community is the equal standing of its members a sense of belonging awareness and the ability to cope with failure i e the ability to absorb disruption and change while maintaining its basic functions and structure an alternative to developing one undesirable alternative is the continuation of never ending and improving public conflict and dissatisfaction amongst all parties which can lead to a administration is the significant weakening of the legitimacy of development programmes and of decisions by the authorities careful planning is replaced with chaotic development policies or their approval of individually enforced projects unsustainable settlement development and a waste of resources on incoherent infrastructure another undesirable alternative is a reduction in the power held by local government and stronger regulation which may also be dependent on the influence of participants outside government solutions will be looked at and delivered in a clearer way and less tailored to local possibilities opportunities and needs opinion of the european economic and social committee on community led local development clld as an instrument of cohesion policy for the period for local development and development of rural urban and suburban areas strategic framework czech republic competence and quality of regional public administration for the sustainable development of settlements the performance of regional the economic performance of the spatial units and the quality of life public administration is of their population directly and significantly influence their management and coordinated it respects the development the steps taken by households and companies as well as principle of and cooperation between individual sectors of public administration typically takes advantage of functional areas have a greater positive or negative effect in functional areas i e cities and their suburban backgrounds than in more populated areas therefore synergies and coordination across departments regions and different levels of government are needed these are often insufficient today regulation at various levels of government often creates contradictory incentives and the principle of is also not applied consistently the problem is compounded by the fragmentation of public administration at the level of municipalities and especially in large and politically complicated metropolitan areas and urban regions the oecd survey has shown that this fragmentation leads to and ineffective decision making there is a need to strengthen the coordination of decision making across administrative boundaries within functional areas i e in determined by the character of settlements and forming functional units examples of such an administrative complex may be metropolitan areas and iti an integrated tool for their development it is necessary to continue by the state wants to complete the ongoing reform of regional reform of public public administration to simplify and consolidate the existing system first administration of all it is necessary to establish clarity and coordination of public administration activity as well as of the regional administration structure prerequisites for high quality management performance at the base level also need to be considered in this respect oecd recommends that the czech republic considers joining up municipalities however from a realistic viewpoint it considers this effort to be politically difficult to enforce however the administrative reform will not affect the character of the czech republic s settlement directly therefore it is preferable for the state to set minimum standards for the availability of public services which will have been considered through strategic and spatial planning and to support integrated planning and inter municipal cooperation in terms of sharing public services collaboration of municipalities needs to be further enhanced especially in terms of the principle of and search for its new forms which will be particularly appropriate for the exercise of delegated powers possible compulsory tasks of local administration and the search for consensus at the local level oecd oecd czech republic municipalities and regions the basic skill for community successful urban or municipal development is built on robust and management is strategic stable local governance it has to rely on sufficient institutional capacity planning and management expertise and mutual communication between all participants of change in the territory local administration companies citizens universities and research organisations associations not for profit organisations and informal initiatives it should not only reach a few current objectives but also regularly assess local life from the point of view of sustainable development quality of life and fulfilment of national policies public administration should set tasks and measurable goals and achieve them in clearly controlled policies not only do they need to know the current standard of legislation regulations and norms and rely on expertise but they also need to understand sustainable development have managerial skills and know how to work with local partners it is necessary to create high quality public administration also requires adequate conditions for quality determination of the scope of application of the criteria performance of municipal competencies should correspond to the possibilities of the municipalities of competences at different the given category and to the public administration bodies at the given levels level legal regulations and financial relations should support a conceptual and comprehensive approach to the fulfilment of public administration tasks including establishment and enforcement of minimum standards for the availability of public services in the territory given the regional the scope of the state administration tasks carried out by capacities the mec need to municipalities with extended competence mec needs to be improved be strengthened this is also necessary in the context of the systematic support they should provide to other municipalities in their administrative district and which are not yet established in the form of a legal obligation this systematic support is necessary due to the large number of municipalities in the regions which naturally limits the possibilities of systematic assistance from the regions the municipality should not development of municipalities should be ensured by linking spatial dispose of its property planning with its own land policy positive foreign examples of good governance are generally created in situations where there is a preference for municipalities to develop land they own thereby diminishing the conflict of interest between the public and private sectors participation promotes the the resilience of cities and municipalities is by the resilience of cities consensus between authorities and local partners the public administration must also involve citizens in their decision making process and consult with them on their proposed actions starting with planning and ending with implementation see also paragraph the realisation and development of proven methods ma clld supplemented by for example the majority of owners of the major development project of the new vienna district of are in the public sector see p ve prostor v m m st in ve prostor ve pp we would also like to point out the approach adopted by the city of stockholm during the restoration of former brownfield sites that also included active spatial planning policy see leke v a a strategic framework czech republic partial innovative processes such as participatory budgeting represents an opportunity for the near future documents must be linked in terms of sustainable development of settlements and regional both vertically and development in general it is important to ensure the interdependence of horizontally documents at both the horizontal level e g continuity of regional or urban documents and vertical e g continuity of national regional and municipal level in order to provide a meaningful development of cities and municipalities it is important to ensure that the decision making process concurs across decision making bodies for example that different unions of the same city unite their goals and plans and from the top to the bottom for example the region s intentions must respect the state policy the state also wants to encourage cooperation between local authorities even across borders and to share examples of appropriate solutions strategic and spatial spatial planning documents must be linked to strategic documents at planning documents must be the level of cities and municipalities a link needs to be established between strategic plans and spatial plans a strategic plan describes what the city or municipality would like to work towards a spatial plan sets out the concept of regional development and its regulation in terms of area and space in order to do this the plan needs to know the development goals and intentions of the strategic plan similarly it is necessary to ensure the consistency of spatial planning documents at all levels and to link them with strategic and documents that have a spatial impact regional public authorities need to strengthen the knowledge and skill base of staff administration workers and workers in four areas employees and office workers should gain should be capable of expertise not just the development of knowledge in their own field but meeting the demands also long term management of a complex agenda and a coherent expected of them approach they also need to hone their communication skills in order to be able to interact with the public to moderate and facilitate discussion between various partners to present their colleagues with modern practices and to work effectively with various public administration bodies and with various hierarchical levels within its structure they also need to be competent in planning strategic planning and management across varying and in evaluating results particularly data processing networking and sharing good regional and municipal authorities should further develop networking practice promotes community cooperation between municipalities including the international dimension development e g energy cities and other initiatives to ensure the transfer of good practice examples at all levels many municipal associations in the czech republic have long term networking experience mi ka p ed anal za ob v esk pp municipalities and regions adaptation of settlements to climate change the impact of climate forecasts expect gradual climate change in the czech republic over change will affect all types of the next few decades even if we manage to partially reduce the rate at municipalities and territories which the temperature rises summer and winter temperatures will be higher than in previous decades there will also be more summer heatwaves and extreme droughts which will occasionally alternate with very heavy rainfall the drought will be most hazardous for south moravia the area south of brno ina and locations with a lower altitude in the northwest half of bohemia from the region through down to the lower oh e basin water shortages and more frequent floods are therefore to be expected water quality will fluctuate in big cities the influence of the so called urban heat islands will increase the temperature difference between the cities and the surrounding landscape will grow groups of people with a reduced ability to maintain body temperature will be affected the elderly sick and very young children drought and heat may also have a negative effect on the operation of buildings as well as all types of transport the impact of climate so far czech cities and municipalities have made little effort to change will be reflected in prepare for the complex impact of climate change adaptation and both spatial planning and mitigation at local and regional level requires responsible spatial planning crisis management for agricultural management thoughtful creation of landscape structures that have a positive impact on the landscape soil biodiversity and that improve the functional link between natural and urban structures resilient ecosystems strengthening the link between spatial planning population protection and crisis management and taking into account the negative impact of climate change will ensure better protection of people property and infrastructure from natural disasters long term droughts extreme temperatures floods and heavy rainfall extreme wind and dangers settlements have always been an integral part of the landscape and they always will be the impact of climate change in relation to the effects of will further increase the impact of settlements far beyond their land registry office on the associated landscape e g on river basins and streams the need to preserve or restore the functional interconnection of natural and urban structures in the wider landscape will grow and planning needs to be

important and will become a daily part of life planning must support increasing the capacity for artificial recharge retaining and using precipitation water in cities as well as increasing the amount of water in public areas such as rivers fountains etc such solutions must be considered as part of the decision making around the use of water resources and not only based on the control of the infrastructure cities must be green and access to nature will be an important dimension of quality of life in their operations more urban spaces cities and municipalities are currently taking insufficient ecological action needed to adapt to climate change appropriate measures must be gradually integrated into strategic and spatial planning it is necessary to create a dense network of small and large green elements that will systematically make use of inner courtyards lawns walls and roofs of large buildings a green and ecological city also encompasses urban farming apart from the areas themselves it will also provide support for their natural diversity research shows that the greater the number of birds butterflies and plants in the greenery the more valued by inhabitants it is also necessary to remove obstacles and risk factors for animals glazed walls etc cities must start measuring there is also a need to reduce the energy intensity of cities cities carbon footprint as part of must be prepared for possible power outages and reduce its dependence sustainability evaluation on fossil fuels the state will support cities in reducing pollutant emissions and in preparing carbon footprint plans a good example is the european initiative covenant of mayors whose participants have decided to cut co emissions by two fifths by and to implement adaptation measures to mitigate the risks and negative impact of climate change on their territory each is preparing a sophisticated plan for sustainable energy and climate protection there are already nine pilot czech cities and municipalities who have signed up as members of this initiative which is still a low number compared to countries within central and eastern europe requirement to construct the state wants to continue to help cities and municipalities make buildings capable of major changes in heating or cooling reducing building energy maintaining a comfortable performance using locally available energy sources and developing public temperature transport and sustainable mobility the state wants to support both household and municipal programmes the challenge is not only to keep the heat in the house during the cold season but to maintain a comfortable temperature throughout the year it will not be a piecemeal project but a systematic transformation of cities existing buildings will undergo renovations that will help to bring the maximum possible energy savings deep renovation besides insulation part of the programme must include screening for external windows and glazed facades transverse ventilation fuller r a irvine k n devine wright p warren p h gaston k j psychological benefits of increase with biodiversity biology letters municipalities and regions etc over the next years civil engineering will more or less update new buildings in line with passive energy standards new emerging solutions including energy storage or and technologies electricity heat and cooling will start to appear on the market urban energy should be cities and municipalities should also transform from simple energy consumers to producers and local providers and to use locally available energy sources urban smart grids and a higher share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix will appear in the urban environment see paragraphs and we can also expect development of integrated projects that will combine various solutions in one city or municipality including various technologies e g use of current surpluses of solar power to recharge electric cars or heat from industrial waste used for heating purposes sending usable and recyclable waste to landfill will be prohibited mixed communal waste after dividing the waste into materials that can be used and biodegradable waste will be used in particular in the purpose built facilities in accordance with the applicable legislation cities need to learn how to changes in energy will affect the ordinary municipal waste disposal handle waste efficiently and process the state wants to continue to work with cities and municipalities make the most of it to improve recycling including the return of organic matter to the soil separation of should become standard practice for czech cities and municipalities over the next years it should be used to compost or produce biogas and the state will support the state wants to encourage cities to move away from car usage non and increase the share of electric mobility including electric vehicle motorised and integrated recharging and renewable mobility transportation must take into account public transport the needs of the population as a result of ageing and lifestyle changes new urban transportation policies will move away from unilateral preference and will favour individual motoring through sustainable urban mobility plans local administration should motivate people to change their transport behaviour towards more sustainable forms of mobility but also address significant administrative restrictions as well as charging entry or private parking for some city locations there is also a need to invest in the cycling and pedestrian infrastructure support for shared transportation and services and the creation of a network of dedicated roads walking and cycling trails in line skating rinks pavements etc and compact accessible neighbourhoods a reliable and clean public transportation system will form the backbone of transportation in the regions although it will continue to provide individual carriers the state wants to gradually integrate regional transportation systems into national interconnected timetables unified transportation conditions mutual recognition of tickets minimum transfer distances and a common information system it also intends to link public transportation to individual transportation via bike and ride systems building sites and equipment for safe bicycle storage near public transport stops or terminals park and ride building car parks close to public transport stops or terminals and kiss and ride setting up strategic framework czech republic stopping or waiting places for passenger cars in the vicinity of

public administration uses the tools for sustainable development of municipalities the central state administration systematically supports and develops tools for the sustainable development of municipalities regional public administration has sufficient institutional capacity to deliver a sustainable development agenda the number and quality of local agenda will increase global development vision the czech republic as a confident and cooperative member of the international community contributes both through its domestic and foreign policies to the promotion of values and principles of sustainable development in the eu and the world introduction positive actions by the in certain areas of sustainable development the czech republic is czech republic in the field of successful even by international comparison significant results have been sustainable development achieved primarily through coordination with other eu countries and the organisation for economic co operation and development above all the responses of the czech republic to global developments as well as the adoption of the agenda for sustainable development and sustainable development goals and the contribution to the adoption and implementation of the sendai global action plan on disaster risk reduction see development analysis are considered outstanding the czech republic will use this favourable situation to support the fulfilment of global and domestic sustainable development commitments and to promote its sustainable development priorities through coherent external policies and its actions in the european union and international organisations the impact of the czech some aspects of the development of the czech republic and the republic on global european union influence the direction of sustainable development in non sustainable development eu the czech republic will strive for the coherence of external policies of sustainable development through closer coordination at the domestic level in order to fulfil its global responsibilities sustainable development the czech republic will encourage the world community to use its agenda and multilateral existing infrastructure of international organisations to fulfil its sustainable system development commitments the czech republic does not consider it necessary to create new international organisations and mechanisms however the multilateral system cooperation among individual participants and cohesion of their actions need to be streamlined in order to achieve a see government of the czech republic government resolution of january no to the report on the course and results of the united nations summit on sustainable development global development more successful and effective fulfilment of all the commitments of the global integrated sustainable development agenda national sustainable given the limited human and financial capacities of the czech development priorities in a republic it is appropriate to focus on a limited number of priority areas global context these topics should logically be based on the national priorities and comparative advantages of the czech republic as well as on the current international contexts the formulation of national sustainable development priorities for global action will be based on the czech republic strategic framework sustainable development one of the main principles and key instruments for fulfilling the policy must be coherent at all commitments of sustainable development at both domestic and global level levels is an integrated approach based on ensuring the coherence of sustainable development policies the external impact of individual national policies should not be detrimental towards other countries especially developing countries the individual activities underpinning sustainable development policies must be interconnected and coherent at local national regional and global levels the interconnection of individual aspects and elements is a prerequisite for the effectiveness and balance of efforts for sustainable development both in terms of resource and capacity utilisation on the part of those who provide them and in terms of impact on the part of those who accept them developing partnerships besides participation of the government parliament and other state among participants and public institutions the preparation and implementation of effective measures to promote global sustainable development also require participation of partners outside of the public sector these partners are representatives of the civil sector private companies academia and the general public sustainable social consensus must be based on cooperation in partnership a global environment conducive to sustainable development global commitments to the czech republic is a responsible member of the international sustainable development community to maintain this status above all it must comply with the sustainable development commitments it has made including regular reporting due to higher democratic legitimacy the czech republic shall support the global agenda of sustainable development in the long term perspective particularly within the framework of the united nations in the field of foreign policy national priorities are reflected in the ministry of foreign affairs of the czech republic of the foreign policy concept of the czech republic which also mentions sustainable development in chapter in terms of international regions strategic framework czech republic eu trade policy vis vis non in the european union the czech republic as an open economy eu countries must be intends to support new trade agreements with other states or blocks if they consistent with sustainable respect the principles of sustainable development it will also support development multilateral agreements of the world trade organization while respecting the same principles the czech republic wants to apply these trade treaties to prevent social dumping and to give signatories an explicit and effective right to use social environmental consumer and hygienic regulations according to their needs and to be consistent with sustainable development it will further promote coordination in the field of tax reforms the czech republic will also actively contribute to a fundamental review of existing but obsolete frameworks and instruments such as the cotonou agreement development aid will be in order to strengthen its political position credibility and operational increased to of gni capacity the czech republic will also strive to meet international financial and its effectiveness will be commitments in the area of official development assistance oda and to regularly evaluated take steps to fulfil its commitment by gradually increasing its level of of gni by emphasis will be placed on the effective use of funding and experience in favour of reducing inequalities and achieving sustainable development in the world in its foreign development cooperation the czech republic will also focus on the implementation of recommendations from the oecd s peer review in which commended the functional institutional system of czech development cooperation and humanitarian aid as well as a specific contribution of the czech republic to reducing poverty and inequality in partner countries support for the agenda at the global level the czech republic will promote the for sustainable development implementation of the agenda and global agendas on climate change resilience and disaster readiness and its cooperation in its work with international organisations it also wants to support the mindset change that agenda strives to bring into the global agenda of sustainable development special emphasis is on the sustainable development objective no peace justice and strong institutions with a particular focus on the promotion of responsible and transparent institutions that are honest and open with the public and ensure this focus is based on the long term priorities of czech foreign policy the promotion of democracy good governance and human rights this goal has a cross sectional validity it is impossible to achieve efficient and long term fulfilment of other goals without it a peaceful and coherent democratic society is also a prerequisite for security and stable international relations strengthening the value responsible actions taken by international organisations also require added of the czech republic a consistent and coherent approach to sustainable development debates in for its operations in an international forums as it also contributes to spreading the reputation of the international environment czech republic around the world it also helps to strengthen its value added in international organisations both at home and abroad and for this reason the czech republic will develop coordination to effectively enforce its own priorities and czech expertise in international organisations to ensure the czech republic s participation in their global development decision making processes implementing the czech republic into programmes and projects of these organisations as well as to support czech experts especially in the elected bodies of international organisations coordination of operations at in order to operate consistently and efficiently at a global level and a global level within international organisations the czech republic will actively enhance its coordination capacity in the field of sustainable development the main coordinating body is the government council for sustainable development and its respective committees at the working level the foreign development cooperation council coordination is responsible for the issues related to foreign development cooperation and humanitarian aid provided abroad policy coherence progressive revisions of the czech republic will outline the national sustainability priorities policy documents and described in this document the principles and objectives of agenda instruments for external as well as other international commitments made to the main external policy relations and external relations policy instruments and strategies at multilateral and bilateral levels such as the foreign policy concept czech republic security strategy concept of foreign development cooperation and the transformation cooperation programme as well as the relevant business tax energy migration and other policies which come under the responsibility of other departments which have an impact on other countries and on the external relations of the czech republic these include for example export strategy of the ministry of industry and trade of the czech republic the state environmental policy of the ministry of the environment of the czech republic the strategy of the ministry of agriculture with a perspective to and the concept for assistance to refugees and states under strong migration pressures of the ministry of the interior see development analysis policy coherence will be taken into account both in legislative activities and in the implementation of partial policies and programmes both at home and abroad the czech republic will also seek to ensure that the european union and other relevant international organisations of which it is a member reflect coherently the agenda in their internal policies and external policy instruments building capacity to monitor the public administration will strive to create sufficient institutional policy coherence for and analytical capacities to ensure policy coherence for sustainable sustainable development development monitoring the impact of policies on other countries will help reduce the negative impression held of the czech republic in these countries see development analysis and strengthen the value added of the czech republic s external actions in the political security environmental trade and development sectors the central state administration of the office of the government of the czech republic will build capacity for monitoring policy coherence to ensure the necessary expertise capability and range across the state administration and thematic focus on the area of sustainable development strategic framework czech republic monitoring the coherence of the czech republic will push for the european union to jointly policies at global and eu promote sustainable development on the international scene it will also level seek to make the key principles for the czech republic integral to eu concepts strategies and documents and to ensure that national priorities are duly respected in eu priorities for sustainable development one of the priority themes is the coherence of internal and external eu policies for sustainable development adequate self sufficiency will an appropriate response to unsustainable ways of producing many benefit ecosystems in other imported raw materials see developmental analysis with a significant countries impact on the external security of the czech republic is the support of the consumption of domestic raw materials wherever possible and beneficial for the quality of the environment economic model coordination mechanisms to the core coordination mechanism for tackling issues related to policy monitor policy coherence coherence for sustainable development is the government council for sustainable development and its committees at the working level coordination in the european union committee and the ministerial coordination groups is ongoing to monitor the coherence of eu policies for other external impact policies the coordinating role of the economic and social agreement council team can be used monitoring policy coherence will be or perhaps already is embodied in the statutes of these bodies strategic objectives the czech republic co creates an environment actively supporting sustainable development at a global and european union level and with an emphasis on national priorities the czech republic promotes the global implementation of international commitments in the field of sustainable development their implementation at the european union level and their reflection in the activities of international organisations and fulfilment of these commitments the czech republic at both global and european union level supports the fulfilment of the sustainable development objectives and specifically objective no peace justice and strong institutions the czech republic increases its value added for operations in international organisations and the european union by reinforcing the coherence of internal policies with external impact the czech republic supports global sustainable development global development the czech republic continuously pledges international commitments and national priorities in the field of sustainable development which have been developed into policy documents and external policy instruments the czech republic is actively building institutional capacity to monitor the coherence of internal policies with external impact and to limit their negative impact on the global move towards sustainable development the czech republic actively promotes the monitoring and implementation of policy coherence at european union level in the external policies of the european union and at the global level good governance vision the czech republic has a mode of governance that is both democratic and efficient in the long term perspective the decision making structure is resilient flexible and inclusive citizens participate in decision making on public affairs and the state creates suitable conditions to facilitate this public administration enhances the quality of life of the population of the czech republic via public policies and achieve the goals of sustainable development in the long term perspective introduction good governance turns the plans for sustainable development of the czech republic will sustainable development into only ever remain on paper unless we are able to manage such plans well action the quality of governance is fundamentally evident through our quality of life it decides what our schools or hospitals look like it also influences whether we are disadvantaged at work because of our gender or age people and society through governance mechanisms we determine the level of taxes or conditions for innovative business economic model for example if public transport will work in our village or if a new building municipalities and regions will be built on neighbouring land good governance also ensures that the first torrential rainfall does not wash away the soil from the field onto the village green or that people are able to walk down a shady alley resilient ecosystems we are all able to make decisions about our activity within the czech republic as well as beyond its borders global development we also see the quality of governance reflected in the ability to express our views about public affairs in dealing with the public administration or in the possibility of fast track justice good governance is a matter the state can influence many things however achieving the vision of for all good governance in a democratic republic is not only a matter for the state but for all citizens of this republic the state creates opportunities and incentives that can be ineffective if there is no active interest in their application the czech republic shows that good governance can be achieved if we work on it together better policy making to achieve good governance the czech republic sets a comprehensive goal of a better way of policy making a human centred way that is inclusive transparent and pursued on the basis of the strategic framework czech republic necessary knowledge and skills a way that will take the long term impacts and side effects of decisions into account resulting in coherent public policies a way that should be able to improve itself systematically to innovate democratic governance more inclusive governance the czech republic will increase the inclusiveness of governance i e the real possibility of involving its citizens in decision making on public affairs or more precisely into the policy making process present dominant democratic forms will also be improved this means that constant attention will be paid not only to elections e g to the maintenance of equality of electoral law availability of polling stations etc and to the functioning of political parties e g ensuring their transparency but also to the promotion of greater representation of women in decision making positions instruments of this improvement and support need not only be legislative but may also be cultural administrative technological etc there will also be greater use of participatory forms of democracy which emphasise direct involvement in the decision making process and democracy oriented towards discussion and mutual for example public consultation on legislative proposals whether by the government or by anyone else using referendums or inviting citizens to co decide on budgetary priorities participatory budgeting especially at the local level civil and social dialogue at eu level also offers considerable opportunities public policies as a result of the deliberation of public policies brings many opportunities deliberation and not power deliberation is a discussion method in which we try to justify our attitudes superiority this discussion is open everyone has the opportunity to speak the basic logic of the such discussion is argumentation and not depends on power dominance e g number of votes or privileged position the main objective is mutual assurance that different perspectives will be taken into account in decision making and that they will be taken seriously deliberations can take place at all phases of policy making process it can be used to discuss proposals in assemblies at all levels and one form may be a substantive and responsive discussion between the government coalition and the opposition however deliberation should be used to a greater extent at the phase of policy formulation setting its origins and objectives and through the direct involvement of citizens the technical solution may be different e g public forums based on the so called mini publics concept working groups involving various participants individual in depth interviews or focus group polls various forms of public consultation using e government frameworks etc obstacles to representation the czech republic will remove obstacles that prevent or complicate participation and deliberation good representation participation and deliberation there are not many legislative barriers and immediate technical barriers are relatively easy to remove in the long term perspective we must therefore focus mainly on barriers that restrict access to certain information barriers that restrict access to certain skills and obstacles linked to social inequalities good governance easier access to information easier access to information can be ensured in a variety of ways first of all by developing an e government system or generally by building an open data infrastructure furthermore by strong public service media and by supporting the building of professional backgrounds for political parties etc learn to discuss participation and particularly deliberation are soft skills we can learn to master them and become aware of their inclusion in the education system including adult education however they are improved mainly by use the more citizens are involved in the debate the more meaningful their next debate will be discussion skills may not only develop open political forums but they also represent opportunities for employee participation or participation in the form of co operative business economic model apart from the economic dimension both forms also have participative and dimensions reducing inequalities in in a democracy rights are guaranteed by law they are equal for all society and provide citizens with support of the high quality and swift decision making of the legal system without any significant regional deviations however it is not enough to grant citizens formal rights to achieve democracy they must also have real opportunities these will always be different due to different personal interests skills etc however some people are also limited by social barriers the removal of which is the task of the state reducing the poverty rate eliminating gender inequalities or inequalities in education people and society are also essential for democratic governance democratic thinking is open in the czech republic there must also be room for alternative thinking about how to govern democratically because it is not possible to estimate the democratic needs from scratch and to develop appropriate forms for decades to come the czech republic will create this directly in the form of state support for scientific r d however the source of innovation in democratic governance can also come from the proposals of various think tanks and ngos the work of so called political institutes in political parties the activities of municipalities etc good intentions are not any particular form that will increase governance s inclusiveness enough must always be considered long term impact and impact on other areas must be taken into account experience from other countries as well as experimental implementation of new solutions on smaller samples i e different forms of piloting may also help innovation in democratic governance should also be retrospectively evaluated with respect to meeting the objectives set and taking into account their side effects strategic framework czech republic long term effectiveness of governance public administration values the long term effectiveness of governance particularly depends on the long term effectiveness of public administration which therefore face high demands and expectations public administration should be transparent predictable accessible and should not violate the impartiality principle in order to achieve unauthorised private gain it should be effective and it should be able to respond to changes and learn from experience each of these aspects is important and none of them must be systematically neglected however there is tension among the different types of expectations or more specifically among instruments to fulfil them the fulfilment of different expectations associated with public administration must therefore be balanced against the current situation and the mission of the particular institution given that in the czech republic the functions of public administration are performed both by the state administration and through the competence transferred via local administration it is necessary to take into account the differences between them in the claims of specific institutions horizontal and vertical the czech republic shall improve the policy coherence by improved coordination horizontal and vertical coordination in policy making process horizontal coordination will be both intra and e g within ministries and among ministries at regional level etc this requires a sufficient institutional background and intensive day to day communication we can use existing communication channels or the existing network of strategic and analytical services in different institutions if they have the necessary skills abilities employees and budget the system of employee circulation such as internships in other ministries or other regions support for internships in the european commission exchanges through different networks and associations of cities and municipalities or regions will also help vertical coordination should take the form of circulation of suggestions solutions and experiences consider impact in advance another important step towards achieving policy coherence will be to and evaluate the outcomes strengthen the strategic approach and greater emphasis on preliminary retrospectively impact assessments and for each decision consideration should be given to impact on other areas side effects especially long term impact and if possible to developing variants solutions particular impact assessment tools are mainly ria regulatory impact assessment eia environmental impact assessment tia territorial impact assessment sea strategic environmental assessment or hia health impact assessment we can create more tools in the future if necessary however it is not sufficient to formulate good policies it is also necessary to evaluate them retrospectively and modify further according to these evaluations e g to perform parametric adjustments to systems to adjust less effective regulation to reduce the good governance administrative burden on citizens entrepreneurs companies and public administrations etc for the purposes of evaluation it is necessary to clearly define the purpose to be achieved by the given public policy and to pursue this purpose this will enable public policies not only to improve but also to better manage the resources competencies financial resources personnel etc policy coherence not only on coordination and coherence of public policies does not only concern the inside but also on the the territory of the czech republic it will also be applied at european and outside global level from preparation of documents for government meetings in eu institutions to coordinated activities in functionally defined international organisations global development policy coherence not only of the policy coherence is not just a matter of executive power greater executive power but also of emphasis on coherence especially on impact assessments on other areas the legislative and judicial side effects and long term impact should also be proposed by legislative system bodies the quality of public debate would be improved if legislative proposals by mps and regions used the impact assessment instruments at least as much as government proposals if there is insufficient institutional capacity for this purpose it should be created policy coherence is also not just a matter of policy formulation and decision but also matter of policy implementation and conflicting issues solution here in addition to public administration high quality accessible and fast paced judiciary plays a key role which must not show significant regional deviations in their decisions a prerequisite for such a judiciary is a long term strategy which should set out primarily a model of the administration of justice optimise the organisational processes accelerate the of justice and identify the methods to systematically improve the rule of law these intentions should then be tailored to the institutional capacity of the judiciary human centred approach in the provision of public services the czech republic will focus their attention on individual inhabitants and consider their needs and their lives not the internal needs of public administration in public administration quality management should be enhanced especially on tqm total quality management principles it is not enough to do things right it is necessary to do the right things at the same time public services will be planned by working together more closely with those to be addressed and the public administration will also ask recipients whether or not the service had helped them or indeed whether it had had an adverse effect on them this will allow public policies to be improved synergies to be sought among them and better resource management competencies funds staff etc from the conceptual and technical point of view different e government tools are also appropriate for the service recipient if they are used for the purpose of the service they should go hand in hand with a reduction of administrative burdens for citizens entrepreneurs businesses and public administrations foreign inspiration but not foreign experience may inspire us we need to maintain a level of copying knowledge of such experience and use it wherever possible the czech strategic framework czech republic republic must be able to register change in foreign development and compare its efforts with current trends not past ones however it is necessary to avoid mechanical adoption and implementation of a solution that may not be sufficiently effective in the czech context tools for drawing of foreign experience may be cooperation with scientific organizations education systems for public administration and the promotion of internships in public administrations in other countries or in the european commission first test and discuss then in policy making process it is necessary to honour the count twice implement cut once rule to test the effects of the intended solutions it is crucial to evaluate current knowledge including foreign knowledge and then use different forms of piloting i e testing on small samples with rigorous evaluation suitable opportunities are currently available for example in the regulatory impact assessment process however these pilots must not simply take on the form of scientific experiments they must also have a dimension i e involve those who are about to propose the solution and those who have something to contribute for example professional or public resilience and security the system of governance will be resilient specific security threats can change rapidly as well as their importance but the types of possible impact when these threats are fulfilled are relatively stable therefore a system of crisis anticipation and response will be further developed whether it relates to natural or man made crisis situations e g floods long term droughts epidemics leakage of dangerous substances disruption of important electronic communications systems large scale electricity outage large scale legality violation etc in terms of security there is also a need for coherence of executive and judiciary power for example a good criminal policy in which the punishment component is balanced with the correction component resilience and innovation however in the long term perspective resilience is improved by the ability to prepare for possible changes or adaptability in other words the ability to innovate in the designing and implementation of public policies in general in form of process innovations administrative technological service innovations management innovations and conceptual innovations to a certain extent this is already feasible by however the czech republic will create conditions for innovation to proceed systematically and rightly to their purpose within a shorter time frame it should be possible within the czech public administration to experiment with processes services and other activities in the future it is important to ensure a degree of autonomy for lower levels of public administration a certain type of knowledge and skills and a sufficient information base in services the principle of i e decision making and responsibility at systematic support and the lowest level on which the solution from the citizens perspective is evaluation effective in the long run will be applied consistently in view of this principle we will look for an appropriate institutional set up for specific good governance areas there are public services that are best created from the centre of the administration faced with the of needs however the role of lower levels of public administration where most services are provided in fact and which have an immediate experience of service effectiveness is increasingly important thus lower levels of public administration receive a degree of autonomy that will enable them to innovate and a greater degree of responsibility for innovative solutions autonomy and innovation of course must not undermine policy coherence throughout the czech republic however no solution is only a matter of a single level therefore the systematic support provided by the centre e g specifically tasked departments of ministries on a government level regular meetings a common information system etc and a system of consistent evaluation evaluation and audit of innovations must be added to the lower levels of autonomy and their capacity to innovate all levels must have sufficient institutional capacity to perform their tasks municipalities and regions sufficient knowledge and the czech republic pays particular attention to the development of skills expertise for the policy making process in addition to understanding the diversity of values and experience with the impact from policies expertise and skills are an important factor influencing public decision making this affects not only the institutions that public policy makers primarily create or implement but also those that make decisions about them e g legislative bodies therefore more intensive interconnection of public administration with specialised workplaces such as universities research organisations the academy of sciences of the czech republic and public research institutions pri the state support system for r d will create and encourage this cooperation the public administration s demand for various forms of analysis and counselling will increase which can be provided by specialised departments systematic education the system of public administration employee education intermediaries the latest scientific knowledge contacts with experience from other countries and insight into how to work with these findings it will encourage public administration employees to realise the possibilities and limits of different methods data and information for this purpose it is possible to use the existing forms e g the system of education pursuant to the act on the civil service no coll the act on local self government officials no coll the public administration institute established by the ministry of interior education in a network of municipalities developing ma various forms of cooperation with public universities or a system of internships in public administrations in other countries or in the european commission availability and better data and information are essential to good policy making data quality of data and will therefore be systematically collected and their circulation facilitated information there is also a wide range of domestic and foreign data sources that could be used much more regularly than currently e g so called administrative data of public administration information from companies ngos academic information data from international institutions regulations and strategic framework czech republic legislative process data etc evaluation of policies also provides key information for decision making a system will therefore be developed to regularly update the data and information needs of public administrations linking resources from different areas to enhance coherence of policy making the e government provides a suitable framework for this endeavour assessment of existing policies will be based on evaluations and on a comprehensive system of measurement and public administration evaluation if we want citizens to be involved in policy making and if we want the result to be a meaningful public debate data and information must also be provided to them again tools enabling this may come from e government projects and generally open data approaches both with respect to the right to protection against unauthorised interference with privacy these activities should be linked to the effort to reduce the administrative burden on citizens entrepreneurs companies and public administrations protection against corruption applying the principle of sufficient knowledge of public and discrimination is a fair administration employees and good data and information help to also public policy justification better justify and defence of decisions in the policy implementation phase in particular we need to be able to prevent violating the impartiality principle of public administration by clearly defining public interests by being transparent and whistleblower protecting strategic objectives policy makers have the knowledge and skills to enable them to participate fully in the public debate the education system for public administration employees will develop conceptual thinking and provide the latest scientific knowledge contact with experience from other countries and insight into how to work with this knowledge the education system provided by public education institutions ensures the development of participative and skills of citizens the state system of support for oriented and applied research will ensure a steady influx of knowledge innovation of democracy and long term effectiveness of governance public policies are coherent in respect to the goals of the czech republic strategic framework public administration at all levels will have sufficient institutional capacity to make coherent policies competencies personnel funding communication channels etc good governance public policies will take into account long term impact public administration will monitor such impact within their own strategic materials public policies will be based on available knowledge and systematically assessed in advance with regard to possible impact on recipients and on areas other than primary interest public policies will be systematically evaluated retrospectively ex post evaluation policy makers have quality and accessible data and information for decision making inside the public administration a system for collecting and sharing data and information will be further developed to enable problem analysis variation creation and impact assessment public administration data and information will be accessible in a way that is most convenient for citizens a system of experience exchange between higher and lower levels of public administration among different sectors of government and among czech public administration and public administrations abroad will be developed innovation in public policy making is a progressive solution that enhances the and or long term effectiveness of public policies such innovation is a permanent part of the functioning of public administration at all levels a system of innovation support will be developed in public policy making pilotage will become a part of public policy making wherever it is appropriate in terms of the given policy the deliberation of public policies will be the rule wherever it is appropriate for the given policy the quality of governance has been improved in terms of public policy recipients procedures will be developed to increase the inclusiveness of governance from the point of view of citizens procedures will be developed to improve the effectiveness of public administration in terms of citizens entrepreneurs and companies strategic framework implementation the strategic document czech republic is a comprehensive government document for national regional and local levels it also serves as a transfer mechanism for czech commitments to the european union and the global community in the field of sustainable development it sets six priority areas for development of the czech republic in the long term perspective and strategic and specific objectives specific measures to achieve strategic goals fall within the responsibility of the relevant departments or the office of the government in accordance with current competencies following the approval of the czech republic an implementation document will be prepared and submitted to the government in to determine the mechanism for monitoring compliance and interaction between the strategic and specific objectives of the czech republic and the strategies concepts programmes and measures for all national strategy papers regional development strategies concepts programmes and measures that have a structural impact on the long term development of the czech republic the compliance with the strategic and specific objectives of the czech republic will be assessed the result is to ensure the linkage between the comprehensive strategic document through and ministerial strategies at national and regional levels the tool for tracking the compatibility of strategic goals at each level of government is the strategy database the strategy database should be interconnected with data sources for monitoring indicators e g pdb ris mrd etc figure relationship between strategic and specific goals of cr and measures czech republic strategic objective specific objective specific objective measure measure measure measure ministerial and regional documents and policies strategic framework implementation the implementation document will include a proposal on how to analyse gaps in current policies and identify causes that prevent potential goals from being met at the same time it will determine the responsibility of individual ministries for achieving and fulfilling the goals of the czech republic there will be concrete actions and measures such as regulation of legislation and regulation in general securing financing etc evaluation of the compliance of strategic documents programmes and measures with the czech republic fulfilment of sustainable development principles and progress in quality of life and sustainable development will be assessed by the report on quality of life and its sustainability hereinafter referred to as the report which will be submitted to the government every two years on the basis of indicators approved as part of the czech republic this report will be based on an analytical part that evaluates developments in each priority area with a specific link to strategic and specific objectives the report will also include recommendations on the content of policies or strategic documents concepts programmes and measures data collection and preparation of indicators is ensured by the relevant committee of the government council for sustainable development the department for sustainable development of the office of the government then a draft report based on this data the report is then subsequently discussed in the committees of the government council for sustainable development approved by the council and submitted for discussion to the government on the basis of this and on the basis of interim findings the office of the government enters a dialogue with ministries to ensure compliance with the czech republic non profit and private sector participants not represented in the government s sustainable development council will be invited to prepare a shadow report during the preparation of the report strategic framework czech republic figure participant tree cr it analyses the consistency of department of departmental action in relation to the specific objectives of the cr sustainable based on a review of links between development specific objectives and departmental ministries measures contained in the implementation document it summarises the results in the draft of the report on the quality of life and sustainability for this purpose it also follows a plan of non legislative tasks and a plan of

aforementioned process also ensures alignment of strategic objectives of the cr with strategic documents at international and european level agenda for sustainable development europe strategy sustainable development strategy of the european union the department for sustainable development will play a precise role in the application of sustainable development principles the development of instruments to promote sustainable development and the fulfilment of the strategic objectives of good governance for sustainable development this role will be fulfilled in close cooperation with other agendas the department for sustainable development will also provide support to public institutions to make use of voluntary instruments and innovative approaches as examples of sustainable development strategic framework implementation strategic objectives of cr will be further enhanced by providing a framework for so called voluntary commitments that enable a wide range of participants outside the public administration to subscribe to the objectives and principles of the cr the czech republic is a live strategic document that responds to contextual changes and developments in priority areas the review of the strategic document will be conducted as necessary via a regular assessment by the department for sustainable development or on the basis of identified needs within the
