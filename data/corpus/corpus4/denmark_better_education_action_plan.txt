education of a high international standard and quality will be the key to coping well in a more and more world education is one of our most impor tant competition parameters and a prerequisite for an in creasing and well qualified workforce with up to date skills the education sector must be based on the freedom of choice human beings must come before the system however high professional standards quality relevance and flexibility for all the users of the education system are not a matter of course they require a continuous adaptation to new requirements and improvements in areas where every thing is not as it should be there is a need for innovation the government is therefore presenting its action plan for better education in order to strengthen the proficiency and competence level in upper secondary education in higher education in adult and further education and continuing training the action plan must be seen in close connection with the aims of the and with the government s other initiatives including the growth strategy determined growth in the coming months and years the government will launch a number of major reforms in particular in the gymnasium the hf and the university areas within voca education and training there will be innovation of the commercial and technical programmes in the adult education and in the further education and continuing training areas there will among other things be a further development of the continuing training provision and its connection with the vocational education and training area is to be strengthened new oriented adult edu cation programmes are to be launched the government will furthermore launch some major cross cutting initia among others in relation to improved educational and vocational guidance a strengthening of the natural sciences throughout the entire education system and an improved educational achievement in the different subjects by means of it finally the international element must be strengthened in all courses of education the government has great expectations when it comes to this wide range of reforms and initiatives it is the aim to create challenges for all in our education

education system better institutions for better education c h a p t e r the danish government s vision of better education a well functioning education system of high quality is a basic prerequisite if we are to ensure growth and welfare both for the individual and for the danish society as a whole the danish government has a vision of a flexible education system with the offer of education and training courses at a high proficiency and competence level the courses of edu cation and training must be relevant and meet the business sector s and the public sector s qualification needs further more the education and training courses must meet the requirements of the individual pupil or student also of the most gifted it is the target that danish education and training must match the best in the world also when evaluation and benchmarking are carried out cross nationally this both applies to the general and the oriented courses of education the prerequisite for achieving this target is a significantly strengthened effort within five areas qualifica tions and competences flexibility innovation freedom of choice and output management at the general level the aim is that everyone should acquire a number of individual competences as well as be prepared to take part in society and know about its basic values society is subject to rapid changes technical as well as cultural it is therefore essential to maintain values such as freedom of speech equality tolerance and democracy we must know our past and the basis on which our values are founded in order to be able to face the challenges of the future education should develop pupils and students as indepen dent individuals by promoting such qualities as initiative courage enthusiasm and the desire to learn something new with the rate at which new knowledge is created it is of decisive importance that everybody has a basic foundation of general personal and social competences including the desire and ability to pursue further education it is be coming more and more important to be able to acquire new competences both within one s own profession and in a combination of different professional areas education should make it possible for the individual to cope on his or her own to develop his or her potential and make his or her contribution to the civil society in this way education sustains the community and the common cultural identity all people are committed to the whole both in their choice of education and in their daily efforts as pupils and students are becoming more skilled the ability to take part in a social interaction with others must be challenged in the global economy production and the use of new knowledge constitute the key to increased growth increased employment and increased welfare the government s growth strategy determined growth points at a first class education system as a decisive parameter for ensuring growth and welfare denmark s competitiveness will depend greatly on whether danish education can live up to the requirements of increased proficiency competence and quality as well as progress in the subjects measured by international and not least by eu standards society and the business community depend on staff who are able to use and communicate knowledge and translate new knowledge into innovation in the same way the foundation of an effi cient public sector is well educated staff at all levels furthermore the growth of the danish economy will depend on an increase in the workforce and on keeping potential candidates for early retirement in the labour market the demographic development with an increasing number of older people and a decreasing demographic in take requires that young people move more rapidly through the education system and out into the labour market time wasted wrong choices and waiting periods must be re among other things through a target oriented voca and educational guidance and through better credit transfer possibilities from one course of education to another increased proficiency and competence and quality mea by international standards require a strengthening of the international dimension in education international approaches must be integrated into the teaching in all courses and subjects young people must acquire cultural competences with a view to being able to cope in an inter nationally oriented world research experience from other countries must be included on a par with danish experi ence and knowledge about denmark s international coope ration relations and commitments is a prerequisite for a future proven education sector denmark must take active part in international quality development evaluation and benchmarking and use the results to a greater extent if it is to attain the target of matching the danish education system with the best in the world we must through international cooperation take advantage of the opportunities and be inspired by good examples from other countries with regard to organisation teaching and innovation the recognition of results and credits acquired at educa institutions abroad must to a greater extent contri bute to the international mobility of students teachers and the working population at the same time it must to a greater extent be possible to have experience and prior learning recognised abroad in the higher education area denmark takes an active part in the bologna process which is among other things to ensure a european credit transfer system comparable degrees and better quality in the field of vocational educa tion and training a similar cooperation is in the pipeline the aim of this cooperation is to ensure that the individual can get his or her vocational qualifications recognised and be able to move freely between different jobs in different countries qualifications and competences a high and relevant standard when it comes to qualifica tions and competences must be ensured at all levels of the education system on the one hand in relation to the con tents of the programmes and on the other hand in relation to all the educational courses offered and to the educational structure there must be coherence and progression in the proficiency and competence requirements throughout the entire educa tion system the basic general social cultural and personal competences must be taken into account and the cy and competence requirement the level of the teaching and the relevant competences must be constantly devel oped the educational courses offered must be constantly adapted to the structurally conditioned competence re in the danish business sector the proficiency and competence level on the individual levels of the education system must be ensured inadequate qualifications and competence at one level must not result in dropout from the subsequent level of education the courses of education must be reviewed from a new per in order to identify the profile of the individual subjects and their social relevance it is the aim to ensure dynamic proficiency qualification and competence how ever the overall target is to create a total supply of courses of education where both the quality of the subject matter and the social relevance are in focus the quality of the subject matter and the social relevance in the university programmes must be strengthened through cooperation between universities the business sector sector research institutions and the other knowledge centres the identity of a course of education must be defined through a number of objectives which describe the subject specific expertise and skills which make up the content foundation of the course this foundation will at the same time form the basis of the continued development of com including the various as far as the research based programmes are concerned the driving force is the development of the research the cooperation with the business sector and the cooperation between universi ties and sector research institutions emphasis must be laid on clear formulations of targets for the individual subjects levels of education programmes and institutions complete with clear criteria for the assess ment of the achievement of targets a clearer formulation of targets must on the one hand strengthen the basis for the teaching and on the other hand it must be able to document on a continuous basis how a strengthening of the proficiency qualification and competence level is taking place in the individual institutions the targets must reflect that the programmes are to contain subject specific challenges for all also the most gifted everybody must be challenged to perform their very best the teaching must be target oriented towards the individual pupil with the point of departure in his or her abilities and development potential a strengthening of educational proficiency must contain various concrete targets dependent on whether the focus is on the general or on the oriented courses of education with the point of departure in the general courses of education the target is in particular set on a strengthening of qualification and competence in the natu ral sciences subjects mathematics danish and in foreign languages as far as the research based courses are con the guidance given by the lecturers and their qualifications in pedagogy and communication must be further enhanced flexibility the education system must be able to live up to the recip expectations regarding employees with relevant qual and competences both the structure of the educa tion system and the organisation of the individual courses offered must be based on the greatest possible flexibility also in connection with the students possibilities of choos ing a course of education the focus must be put on lifelong learning modular courses and e learning in the vocational education and training and the short and medium cycle higher education areas recognition of the individual s prior learning must be much more common prior learning is also relevant in connection with the universities master programmes we must move away from the concept where competences are only created within the education system for they are also to a very great extent developed in the place of work through participation in liberal adult educa tion voluntary work in associations etc it should be made possible to acquire competences including entrance com in different ways so that there can be a difference from individual to individual it does not however mean that the government will slacken its subject specific re for instance its entrance requirements for pro grammes leading to on the basis of experience from other countries the government will take an initiative with a view to devel oping reliable and accepted methods for the individual development of competences in cooperation with the busi ness sector and the educational institutions the focus must to a greater extent be set on what a person can do rather than on what he or she has in the form of certificates as many as possible must complete a qualifying course of education however possibilities must be created in particu lar within vocational education and training for people to acquire vocational competences earlier than at present after a period of time it should be possible to get on the educational train again and strengthen and further develop the vocational competences acquired previously it is therefore of decisive importance that the education system can ensure offers of quality and relevance to the individual throughout his or her life it must be possible to acquire vocational competences in various ways and with different of study in this context also the work with credit transfer must be given a higher priority with a view to ensuring flexibility and increased mobility in the education system nationally as well as internationally innovation and entrepreneurship culture flexibility must also support a change of attitude towards a culture which inspires innovation and entrepreneurship the desire to work must be given back to pupils and stu dents and young people must in general be prepared for a working life in the labour market of the future where it is both challenging and attractive to start something new and be independent it is important for the business sector s ability to hold its own against international competition to reduce the dis tance between the birth of an idea in a research environ ment for instance and its conversion into a product mar by a company education is instrumental in ensuring new knowledge and are given the ability to translate research and new ideas into their individual practice we are not performing very well in this area today it is here that the education system has a central role to play there are many talented young people but we do not edu cate a sufficient number of them to become entrepreneurs denmark has an unused potential in this area and the government aims to exploit this potential young people are to be given the tools and competences that enable them to become talented and growth enhancing entrepreneurs the most gifted and most highly educated of them should become knowledge based and high technological entrepre neurs who make use of their competences in a business related context society s investments in education will only give the neces sary yield in the form of growth and welfare if there is a close interaction between the entire education system the university and sector research and the business sector the research results must be to the surrounding world through cooperation with public and private compa nies this requires highly educated employees and an enhanced entrepreneurship culture the government wants better opportunities for and a positive attitude towards innovation and entrepreneurship in the education system this will come through an increased focus on entrepreneur ship culture at all levels and within all courses of education the government will make an effort to strengthen the struc and content related elements required for the inclu sion of innovation and entrepreneurship in our education system and it will therefore present an action plan in the autumn the aim of which is to create more entrepreneurs free choice the government highly values the citizen s free choice there must be a free choice of educational institution and here it is very important for the government that a relevant supply of education and training is ensured all over the country through a regionally balanced institutional struc ture there must be a greater flexibility for pupils and students to adapt their education through courses offered by different institutions for instance within the general upper second ary programmes however it must be stressed that the free dom to put together a course of education must not be introduced at the expense of qualification and competence the institutions should to a greater extent take part in cross institutional network cooperation with a view to supporting flexibility existing barriers to a maximum flexi should be removed the freedom to choose a course of education does of course require that one has the necessary skills and that the future prospects for the subject seem promising there is no sense in educating young people for unemployment when at the same time there is a shortage of people in various sectors the courses of education are therefore not only to support the business sector s need for competences but in impor tant areas also its recruitment needs when it comes to for instance the health area where there is already an increas ing demand for labour the government will consider incen which may increase the intake to the social and health education programmes including the basic social and health education programmes and the nursing programme the same is the case with the natural sciences and technical university programmes where the intake of students and the completion rate must be increased with a view to coping with the shortage of labour in these areas thus in particular the medical industry the it sector and the bio technological companies are growth areas with recruitment problems and a great need for employees with research based qualifications this should be taken into account in the new thinking about research based education pro grammes relevant and available information about the contents qua lity and the achievement of targets is also a prerequisite if citizens and companies are to choose education and school or educational institution freely and on an informed basis transparency and openness will further the basis for lasting choices of both education and institutions and thus for a quicker completion of the programmes the government will present proposals which are to strengthen the educa and vocational guidance effort also involving more coherence across the different sectors the guidance offered should be made more transparent and more easily available to the individual citizen among other things through an increased use of it in this way the guidance offered con tributes to ensuring that there really is a free choice for the individual young person furthermore the guidance of young people must to a greater extent focus on initiatives that sustain entrepreneurship output management the institutions are to be given a greater degree of freedom and a better framework for quality development the educa institutions must have adequate freedom to be able to meet the new requirements of increased quality profi and competences an increased self management requires well functioning sustainable and regionally based educational institutions institutions which can offer flex ible and relevant solutions that are adapted to the compe tence needs of the students and companies and which can ensure strong and relevant educational possibilities for everyone throughout the country a consistent renewal of the way in which educational insti are managed is a cornerstone of the government s educational policy there must be a new and clear division of tasks between educational institutions and central regula tion which places the educational institutions in a stronger position in their daily work and in the organisation of future quality development the management concept must be changed into a coherent development oriented manage ment concept with the focus on principles regarding self evaluation and based on requirements with regard to the institutions entire work on quality as a consequence of the management form a detailed set of rules and subsequent checking of the indi institutions observance of these rules must be re placed by a more result oriented supervision which is to a greater extent characterised by the overall supervision of results and analysis of the institutions framework con for ensuring that they have the optimal conditions for delivering high quality one element in the renewal is greater transparency and openness where among other things output indicators are to provide relevant information for the stakeholders of the institutions students recipients local and regional stake holders staff etc and at the same time create the basis for an active involvement of the stakeholders assessment of the quality and the results provided by the institutions the quality of the teaching and the development of proficiency and competences must be documented through tests and examinations which match the targets set and which render visible the individual students benefit from the teaching there is thus a need to work with the development of new examination and test forms among other things in general upper secondary education and in the university area furthermore it should take place through evaluations of the programmes both self evaluations and evaluations carried out by the individual institution as well as cross cutting evaluations in order to improve and ensure the educational institutions quality development work agreements are used based on the institutions freedom and responsibility for prioritising and weighting the agreements take their point of depar ture in a formulation of action areas and targets for the re educational sectors and the higher education pro grammes with the addition of new action areas and targets to the multi annual agreement from it will require a special effort from management which must initiate and support development projects and be visible also when it comes to salaries the economic framework of the initiatives in the action plan and the follow up to this are the funds already set aside in the budget for including the ministries con version funds etc the implementation of the initiatives must as far as possible take place in the form of agreements which take their point of departure in objective distribution criteria according to which the institutions at the same time commit themselves to reporting in relation to a number of objectives agreed beforehand including a number of indica tors for quality and efficiency in the university area the implementation will take place in connection with struc reforms c h a p t e r educational policy action areas general education the primary and lower secondary education the is the basis of all subsequent education it is therefore of decisive importance that the individual pupil is given the best possible proficiency and competence founda tion to build on when he or she leaves the the most recent international studies have however shown that the proficiency and competence level in the danish skole does not match that of most other countries with which we normally compare ourselves in spite of the fact that it is one of the most expensive in the world against this background the minister of education has among other things launched the proposal steps towards a better which contains a number of initiatives which are to strengthen the proficiency and competence level in the and at the same time the municipalities are to be given greater flexibility when it comes to organising their own school system so that the resources are spent in the most appropriate way in relation to the pupils bene fitting from the teaching in order to support the initiatives in steps towards a better the government will in cooperation with the municipalities ensure a more target oriented and flexible organisation of the in service training and courses offered to teachers this is a necessity both if we are to increase the proficiency and competence level in the actual teaching and if we are to pave the way for the introduction of forms of teaching with an increased focus on for instance integrated school start and group formation across classes and year groups the government s high ambition level for the will also set new and more stringent requirements when it comes to the role of the head teacher in order to provide the head teachers with the necessary tools to perform this role the government will introduce a diploma programme in school management the government s initiatives in the area are thus to be seen in close connection with and as a part of the foundation of the government s action plan for better educa tion general upper secondary education the government will initiate reforms of the gymnasium and hf and as far as necessary of the and htx so that reforms and adjustments form part of a coherent per for the entire area of education a greater focus will be put on the general upper secondary education pro grammes as education courses preparing for further studies at the same time it is the aim to have equal general upper secondary programmes which together and separately are to appear with clear profiles vis vis the other upper secondary programmes the reforms will be carried out as a continuation of the innovation and development work which has been carried out in the past few years the primary target of the reforms is to strengthen the profi and competence level of the programmes so that the academic competences of the general upper secondary pro grammes are improved and so that the content of the pro grammes ensures that the pupils get the competences they need in their further studies hereby a greater conformity regarding the admission requirements to the higher educa tion programmes will be achieved a uniform national proficiency and competence standard is to be maintained in the general upper secondary pro grammes among other things through the formulation of clear targets a national examination system and evaluations at the same time there must be greater flexibility between the general upper secondary programmes themselves including the possibility of free choice between certain op subjects in the different programmes as well as the of teachers the government wishes to have a better exploitation of the cooperation possibilities between the general upper secondary education institutions and will aim at removing the barriers for such cooperation furthermore the aim will be to create a better credit transfer scheme for the general and vocational upper secondary pro grammes where it must be possible to have previously com passed subjects or parts recognised in the case of transition to a new programme so that barriers can be removed and double qualifications avoided the concrete initiatives range from general reforms of the content to more specific initiatives aimed at increasing the proficiency and competence level in special areas such as danish foreign languages natural sciences and tics in the reforms the emphasis is laid on new working and evaluation methods emphasis is also laid on a changed management concept where detailed control of content and input is replaced by an output oriented target and framework management which gives the individual institu tion more responsibility and a freer framework for achiev ing the targets and for documenting the achievement of the targets reform of the gymnasium the target of a gymnasium reform is to improve young people s real study competence and thus strengthen the basis for getting more young people through a higher edu cation programme the gymnasium must give all pupils subject specific and personal challenges better possibilities are to be created for immersion into the subject and inter action between subjects and an increased emphasis is to be laid on the natural sciences the gymnasium has two de aims to give a general education and to prepare for further studies the aim of the teaching is to build on the knowledge gained in the years of the and to contribute to the personal development of the pupils and to develop their interest for and ability to take an active part in a democratic society the present gymnasium has a broad recruitment basis so broad that some pupils consider the competence level of the gymnasium to be irrelevant to them and far too theo when compared with their thoughts about future education whereas other pupils feel that the teaching does not offer them sufficient challenges this gives rise to the ob served lack of study motivation and the increasing truancy the present curricula are very comprehensive and detailed and may be considered to be an obstacle to the develop ment of new qualifications proficiency and competences which make room for new working methods and a greater use of it the many obligatory subjects may be instrumental in limit ing the possibilities of immersion and of making the rele vant choices of subjects with a view to the further choice of education in the danish parliament adopted the development programme for the upper secondary programmes of the future as part of the development programme a great number of specific innovation and development projects and a number of comprehensive structural experiments have been initiated the experience from these innovation and development projects is used in the continuous development of the gymnasium and thus becomes part of the basis for a reform of the gymnasium the reform is to be implemented together with a reform of the hf programme and possible adjustments of and htx so that the general upper secondary programmes together and separately appear with clear profiles the aim is furthermore to increase the interaction between the gen eral upper secondary programmes and a strengthening of the possibilities of the individual school to create its own subject specific profile the target group of the gymnasium is young people who aim at enrolment in higher education and who are interested in knowledge in seeing things in perspective and in abstraction young people who primarily enter directly from the th form of the the gymnasium is characterised by a high proficiency and competence level and by requiring that the pupils have a personal commitment in and a sense of responsibility vis vis the course of study the requirements must be seen in the right perspective so that the pupils acquire a real study competence which is directed towards the higher education programmes as it is a general education programme emphasis must be laid on making it possible for the pupils to develop a personal social and cultural identity with a view to obtaining a strengthening of the real study competence the reform is to be characterised by the fol lowing emphasis on an interaction between subjects proficiency qualifications and competences as opposed to subjects emphasis on immersion target management instead of content management progression in working methods and examination forms with a view to obtaining increased study competence strengthening of the natural sciences subjects and ele ments of education removal of the present division into subject lines and the introduction of a short common introductory period for all students before the final choice of subject combina tions lines subject packages the overall emphasis is laid on giving the individual pupil more options and on target these options more towards the subsequent education and profession this is obtained by setting aside more lessons for optional subjects organised as subject packages and for totally free options and at the same time by allocating fewer lessons to the obligatory subjects these subject packages ensure a greater interaction between the subjects general themes of subject packages may for instance be modern languages classical languages mathematics and natural sciences mathematics and social studies natural sciences and philosophy biology chemistry and social studies within a specific framework the individual school combi nes subjects and levels within the individual subject pack age furthermore it will be possible for the individual pupil to choose free optional subjects for instance creative subjects or a further subject at high level the teaching must take as its point of departure the fact that the pupils come from the th form of the the teaching must be organised so that the pupils curiosity and commitment are encouraged and experimenting ap to the subject matter should be promoted there should be more personal and subject specific challenges and the working methods and examination forms must set the stage so that during the course the pupils will assume an increasing responsibility for their own education the pupils are to be presented with central subjects and with the characteristic methods of these subjects as well as to problem complexes which can be analysed from the point of view of several subjects emphasis is laid on the fact that the pupils experience both the strength and fascination of the individual subjects and the qualities of a greater interaction between the subjects the gymnasium must have a more significant subject spe profile rather than the many specialised subjects in the present gymnasium the individual pupil must have fewer subjects and more time for immersion and study like work forms including more major independent assignments and projects an innovation of the content must be pro on the basis of target than content management target management is to a give greater degree of freedom with regard to achieving the targets and is thus to make room for dynamic proficiency and competence the development from pupil to student must be given great importance clear criteria must be established for the achievement of targets and evaluation forms must be developed which reflect to a greater extent the aims of the teaching emphasis must be laid on extensive use of it in the teaching and in examinations there must be a general strengthening of the natural sciences subjects the teaching must be with a view to promoting the pupils motivation for and interest in technology natural sciences and scientific ways of think ing authentic problem complexes must be included in the teaching and the cooperation with the business sector must be strengthened today the pupils must choose a subject line before they know anything about the contents and working methods of the subjects at the general upper secondary level in order to ensure that the individual pupil acquires a better basis to choose the final subject combination as well as a better basis for a target oriented immersion into the subjects the present division into subject lines will be replaced by a short common introductory period followed by a choice of new subject lines subject packages the introductory package must contain humanities social sciences and natural sciences subjects a conference is planned for the autumn on targets and contents in the pending reform of the gymnasium with a view to drawing up a report for the parliament in january the government will present a bill on a reform of the gym in the autumn of with effect from august reform of the higher preparatory examination hf like the gymnasium programme the higher preparatory examination or hf programme is an academically oriented general upper secondary programme which since the beginning of the s has had a double target a year coherent programme for pupils coming directly from the th form of the and for young people who to begin with have chosen another pro gramme at upper secondary level and who wish to make another choice or who have been in the education system for a while second chance education the year programme is offered primarily by single subject education for adults wishing to study at general upper secondary level single subject hf is offered at adult education centres so called throughout the s serious problems were observed with the hf programme in particular with the year hf pro gramme after the most recent changes of the gymnasium and hf the contents of the two programmes had become too much alike at the same time there were problems with the proficiency and competence level of the hf programme this was on the one hand due to those on the course having a too low proficiency and competence level when entering the programme and a lack of motivation and on the other hand it was due to the short duration of the pro gramme furthermore there was a relatively big dropout from the programme approx these problems motiv ated the initiation of comprehensive experimental work with a and year hf from the school year from the school year the experiments were also extended to also comprise single subject hf at vuc where new types of participants some quite young and others in employment have led to a need for new pedagogical methods and for more flexible forms of organisation the round of experiments has now ended and the final evaluations of the experiments have been published a good basis for a reform of the programme is thus avail able the aim of a reform of the year hf programme is to en sure a well functioning year general upper secondary edu cation programme regarding proficiency and competence improving the hf pupils real study competence and pro a relevant basis for a choice of education and profes sion through the introduction of pupil activating working methods and a strengthened interaction between the sub jects the hf pupils must be stimulated to take a personal responsibility for their own course of education and thereby acquire competences which are more relevant than those provided by the present hf programme the reform of the single subject hf programme for adults is through flexible organisation methods intended to en sure an adult group of course participants better possibilities of qualifying themselves both for further studies and for better job prospects the aim of the reform is to give the structure content and pedagogical organisation of the hf programme an indepen dent profile which distinguishes itself clearly from that of both the other general upper secondary programmes gym and htx and the other adult education pro grammes basically the hf programme is to continue to address itself to young people and adults who want to pursue a pro gramme at general upper secondary level with a view to con in higher education in structure and content the hf programme must be characterised by flexibility so that the teaching can be organised in accordance with the students very different prerequisites and goals in accordance with the typical subsequent choice of study this implies that there are still not to be any requirements about having to take optional subjects at the highest level a as a condition for acquiring a hf examination the students must however have the possibility of choosing subjects at level a hf maintains the general study competence and dependent on the individual student s choice of subjects and levels it may give access to admission to all higher education pro grammes at present it will be possible to supplement a hf examination through the system of supplementary examin ation courses at general upper secondary level gsk and the possibility of participating in for instance commercial and technical programmes at the vocational colleges will be established the flexibility in the programme is in combination with the requirement of a high and strengthened proficiency and competence level among other things an expression of the fact that there are different forms of and approaches to qualifications proficiency and competence as part of this flexibility the role of hf as a power centre for subject specific pedagogical innovation in the general upper secondary programmes is to be re established and devel oped with an increased emphasis on an and it supported approach to the teaching the reform is to lead to a number of quality improvements which provide an innovation of the content on the basis of tar get management rather than content management with emphasis on the core of the subject as well as a subject specific degree of freedom this will allow for local decision making with regard to methods and ways of doing things comprehensively strengthen the proficiency and compe in a new form of which to a greater extent than before will stress the connections between the subjects for instance through project organised teaching ensure the interaction between the subjects through a thorough reorganisation of the major part of the teaching in subject groups consisting of related subjects culture and society mathematics and science and practical subjects the subject groups do not operate with fixed numbers of lessons per subject it is left to the individual course establishment to plan the teaching so that the aims in the curriculum guidelines are met change the teacher and pupil roles and thus the tradi teaching concept not least with emphasis on work shop teaching and on it as a catalyst for teaching lay increased emphasis on the practical and presentation perspective of the subjects the commitment of the students and stimulate them to take responsibility for and take active part in their course of education through the introduction of modern working and organisational methods ensure the achievement of targets through the introduc tion of new evaluation forms which reflect to a greater degree the aims of the teaching make it possible for the individual hf course establish ment to create its own profile of the programme through certain subject packages e g such as languages health the environment pedagogy and communi cation which aim at certain short and medium cycle higher education programme both in the public and the private sector with a reform of the single subject hf courses it is the main aim not least through a clearer distinction between single subjects for adults and the coherent year programme for young people to create better conditions so that a very heterogeneous group of adult students can qualify them selves for further education or strengthen their qualifica tions with a view to getting better job prospects a special ministry of education executive order will be drawn up for single subject hf in full consideration of the connection and interaction with general adult education at lower secondary education level in danish avu the pedagogical improvements of the quality for which the stage is set in a year course may fully apply to single subject hf in those cases where hf subjects are offered in packages aiming at certain higher education programmes also in the case of actual single subject teaching there will be a thorough revision of the traditional teaching concept and the traditional subjects such as the highest possible degree of flexibility is ensured with the many forms of organisation and varying number of lessons which can accommodate adult participants very diverse prerequisites and their wishes and needs in rela tion to further education and work is established for introducing new subjects and offering new teaching in parts of subjects changes will be made in the provisions concerning com attendance in order to accommodate the adult participant s work and life situation this is done in con with the introduction of virtual working methods and evaluations and documentation of the subject specific benefit during the course the government will present a proposal to parliament for a reform of the hf in the autumn of with effect from august development of the oriented general upper secondary programmes and htx the and htx are general upper secondary education programmes with a significant business related content the with the main emphasis on business and socio economically oriented subject areas as well as on foreign languages and the htx with the main emphasis on techni cal and technology subjects as well as on natural sciences subjects they are offered by vocational colleges and in the st year to some extent they have common subjects with the basic course of the vocational education and training programmes the experience gained from this makes it necessary to carry out a more detailed analysis of how the subject specific progression in particular in the st year can be organised with an increased benefit to the pupils in connection with the reforms of the general upper secondary area the focus will be set on the profile and pro and competence level of the programmes includ ing their related content and the study compe tence of the pupils furthermore it is necessary to make an effort regarding strengthening the completion rate this will take place in the period up to the oriented programmes vocational education and training eud and continuing vocational training programmes amu the vocational education and training programmes at upper secondary education level in danish eud and the con vocational training programmes for adults in danish amu are facing major challenges at present from the labour market which demands an increasingly voca well founded and flexible workforce the pro grammes must accommodate a labour market subject to continuous changes with new production methods tech and ways of organising work it is therefore essential that the eud and amu programmes are adapted to the requirements of increased flexibility and a strengthening of the competence level the education and training institutions must offer programmes with a strong and flexible vocational profile the supply of education and training must be broad flexible transparent and innovative and provide the individual with a real possi of lifelong development of his or her competences the point of departure is to a greater extent to meet the needs and expectations of citizens companies and the sectors when programmes are designed and organised the general principle in the vocational and training pro grammes must be that the individual is able to obtain the desired and demanded competences in many different ways and with varying lengths of study systems and rules must not create barriers for the individual or for companies in order to promote employability and ensure a well qualified workforce the learning opportunities must be visible and immediately comprehensible for the individual as well as companies in the eud programmes the alternance training principle is to be assessed and reconsidered with involvement of the rel stakeholders especially the requirements with regard to the duration of education and practical training at the workplace are to be reduced a more differentiated supply of education and training must be developed with varied forms of organisation and admission requirements the balance between practical training at the workplace and school based education must be reconsidered in particular the school based practical training generally the proficiency and com level must be strengthened and it should be con whether some eud programmes should be turned into short cycle higher education programmes the situation regarding the practical training place the pro and competences and the labour market relevance must be reconsidered strengthened guidance must contri bute to reducing the dropout and double qualifications in particular within the commercial eud area among the technical eud programmes it is in particular within the new or rapidly changing employment areas e g the it area that new solutions must be found to problems with demand for labour and shortage of practical training places for the amu programmes focus must be on the develop ment of competences with immediate relevance for the practical training including the interaction between the qualification needs of the company and the development of the individual s competences the amu programmes must have a greater flexibility and the numerous training plans must be transformed into more flexible plans which can respond to needs occurring at local level it should be considered merging the eud and amu programmes when need for this occur in the labour market among other things the credit transfer possibilities between the programmes must be reconsidered and rendered visible easier access must be provided to electronic information about the programmes and a common evaluation system must be developed for systematic quality and result mea a strengthened european cooperation on mutual recogni tion within the eud and amu areas is on the agenda during the danish eu presidency in the nd half of through this the international dimension in education and training and mobility will be strengthened in the following concrete proposals are presented which take up the challenges and formulate initiatives that contri bute to a strengthening of the overall effort within eud and amu areas renewal of the commercial eud vocational and training programmes the eud programmes are facing great challenges in con with recruitment practical training place problems and a huge dropout the programmes which cover a great and differentiated field of employment with very different conditions and development features need differentiated solutions which accommodate the needs of the individual branch or employment areas rather than standardised solu tions for the entire area the government will therefore present proposals for a renewal of the commercial eud programmes which will specifically ensure that more flexible basic and main courses are developed for the commercial programmes courses of different duration and depth are created which are connected with different job profiles and provide a recognised vocational competence at different levels and which subsequently make it possible to start the pro gramme at different levels the pupil gets a better basis for and access to further edu cation and continuing training methods for assessment of prior learning are developed so that credit can be obtained for already acquired compe in relation to the admission requirements and final objectives of the commercial programmes as well as in the case of a change of programme between the commercial and in the case of a change of programme to and from other programmes the interaction between the short cycle higher education programmes and the eud programmes will form part of the work and new solutions will be developed to replace the school based practical training proposals will be presented in the spring of and the legislation will enter into force in renewal of the framework of the technical vocational education and training eud programmes and changes in individual programmes the constant practical training place problems within the technical eud programmes prove that in spite of the increase in the possibility of flexibility in the eud reform there is a need for an initiative which makes the technical eud programmes even more flexible the problems have in particular appeared within new areas of employment and areas where there are great shifts in employment e g the it related area of education an assessment will therefore be made of the practical train ing place situation proficiency and competences the labour market relevance etc cutting across all technical eud programmes with a view to taking initiatives and presenting proposals which ensure flexible courses of education of dif duration and depth and which provide a recognised vocational competence with a possibility of later upgrading it to a higher level furthermore an assessment will be made of the types of institutions which are best suited to offer the various voca oriented programmes e g in the field of agriculture the interaction between short cycle higher education pro grammes the oriented general upper second ary programmes htx and the eud programmes will form part of the work the reflections about new solutions in replacement of the school based practical training will furthermore form part of the work proposals for legislation and amendments will be presented to parliament in initiatives to strengthen a new coherence between eud and amu programmes the government s aim of improving the qualifications of the workforce must be ensured through ori basic adult and continuing training programmes the programmes are to meet the needs of a labour market subject to constant changes where new and more tradi production methods technologies and ways of organising work exist side by side there is a need to ensure a eud system vocational upper secondary education and an amu system continuing vocational training of high quality with strong vocation ally oriented basic courses and flexible adult education and continuing training programmes the education and train ing supply must be broad flexible transparent and func so that the individual has a real possibility of lifelong development of his or her competences therefore a process will be initiated in which the legal basis and the forms of description in the eud and the amu pro grammes are this is to contribute to an optimisation of the supply of single subjects in eud and amu programmes the award of credit for completed labour market training in eud adult vocational training programmes evaluation and measurement of results the coordination of the development work in and trans to eud and amu programmes there is furthermore to be easier access to electronic infor mation about eud and amu programmes in amendments will be proposed to the parliament concerning the of the legal basis and in the administrative systems will be adapted and in systematic evaluations and measurements of results will be initiated further development of the amu programmes development of competences with immediate relevance for the practical training there are more than different training plans in amu each individual training plan is described in a centrally approved plan which indicates the targets and framework of the programme all plans irrespective of activity level are subject to the same development and approval process each individual programme is assessed in relation to the training places which should be able to offer it it is unclear for the users where they are to go and burdensome for the training places who may have to borrow course approvals from each other this implies an inflexible and confusing system which does not to a suffi cient extent meet the user s specific local and regional needs in the shortest possible time therefore a new amu concept must be developed which is more target oriented flexible transparent and dynamic and which can ensure that the training places get a greater local regional liberty of action so that significant parts of the decision making competence is close to the users the approx training plans are to be replaced by much fewer user friendly broad and future oriented de of competence areas within which there must be a dynamic development of national training targets in step with the development in the labour market the users and the training institutions are able to put together amu programmes from the whole range of train ing targets so that a bridge can be built between the learn ing that takes place in the programmes and the formal and non formal learning which is acquired at the work place the training places are able to organise the amu pro grammes in relation to the needs of the users e g in the companies in the form of distance learning and they may shorten the programme in relation to the needs of the individual participants the users can have their previous learning assessed and obtain credits for them in relation to the individual pro gramme or for a competence development plan assessment types and quality assurance tools are suited for assessing the participants and the programmes and thus make the training places output visible the approval procedures of the individual programmes are simplified the approval of training places for competence descrip tions is given in such a way as to promote proficiency and competences economic sustainability and transparency in particular seen in connection with approvals for voca oriented basic courses an efficient interaction between amu and single subject eud etc with a view to obtaining educational synergy and optimal resource exploitation in the autumn the government will present proposals for a new act on oriented adult education and continuing training the proposal is the rd phase of the government s effort to merge and strengthen the education and training offered within the eud and amu programmes the two first phases concerning financial management and institutional structure were adopted in the spring through the act on the financing of labour market training and the act on institutions for oriented educa tion increased european cooperation on mutual recognition within the eud and amu areas the european council has encouraged the implementation of measures in the vocational education and training area concerning mutual recognition of vocational qualifications and competences in relation to transnational employment and participation in education and training corresponding to those adopted in the area of higher education the so called bologna process the background is the increasing importance that is being attached to vocational education and training when it comes to increased employment mobility etc inspired by the bologna process within higher education the com mission has taken the initiative to establish a strengthened european cooperation regarding mutual recognition of vocational qualifications and competences the danish government has therefore decided that the vocational edu cation and training area is to be given a higher priority during the danish eu presidency this specifically implies that the government will work for the adoption of a resolution on a strengthened cooperation between european countries in the vocational education and training area the resolution is to contribute to over coming the obstacles to mobility and ensuring the recog of qualifications in relation to employment and participation in education across national boundaries at national level the initiative is to contribute to the achievement of the targets regarding an increase in the workforce and in particular foreign citizens access to the labour market and the education system at european level the initiative is to contribute to increased mobility transparency and the development of a closer co operation on quality development in the field of education as well as to support the prioritised targets set by the eu among other things in relation to the employment area as well as targets in relation to the development of the educa tion systems courses building on the vocational education and training eud programmes the government would like all young people who are studying to meet challenges which match their com this also applies to pupils participating in voca education and training courses the legal framework must therefore be provided so that eud students can acquire a general study competence in addition to their vocational competence the study compe tence is to be acquired through a course of education which is adapted and which utilises the relevant parts of the eud programme including both periods of time in the school and practical training at the workplace the vocational competence of the pupils is obtained in a course which comprises the ordinary eud programme but it requires the student to complete a number of the basic and optional subjects of the programme at general upper secondary level it may furthermore be required that the practical training is organised in such a way that the aims of the practical training are attained within a shortened period of training practice by building on the synergy between the and educationally qualifying elements of the total course the total duration of the pro gramme must still be held within a framework of approx years the organisation of vocational education and train ing programmes with this addition will require a more flexible credit transfer system so that different subjects or courses can to a certain extent replace each other and will require the possibility of distance learning in particular during the students practical training periods a bill will be presented to parliament in the autumn of vocational basic programmes egu organised by production schools a number of production school pupils do not acquire suffi cient skills for continuing in an ordinary programme or in employment a flexible egu programme short vocational basic courses can contribute to countering this problem through its strong guidance element and the very wide pos of acquiring vocational competence within all employment areas e g as farm workers cleaners or social and health service assistants the close professional and pedagogical environment of the production schools is found to be an adequate point of departure for organising and carrying through egu programmes among other things the schools have good contacts with the local busi ness sector and they therefore have the possibility of find ing practical training places for the egu participants furthermore through an in depth knowledge of the indivi dual egu participant the schools are able to follow the participants in the egu course which as a main rule will take place outside the production school with practical training hosts and at other training places e g technical colleges today the egu is organised by the municipalities for special target groups the vocational colleges are respon for the organisation approx half of the ties primarily urban municipalities use the egu there is thus a geographical imbalance as the production schools are primarily located in small municipalities it will be possible to complement the municipal effort through an egu organised by production schools through the close contact between the municipalities and the production schools it should be possible to ensure a coordinated effort it is thus the aim that the egu is to be developed all over the country to be offered to the target group of academ weak young people or young people who have not made up their minds about their future career the production schools must be provided with the same possibility of organising egu programmes as the vocational colleges i e for the often academically very weak group of young people who do not have the prerequisites for follow ing one of the ordinary upper secondary programmes a bill will be presented to parliament in the autumn of higher education to meet the challenges in the global economy denmark needs an education system of high quality and with a high proficiency and competence level measured on an interna scale if we are to ensure growth and welfare both for the individual and for the danish society in the global economy production and the use of new knowledge are the keys to increased growth increased employment and greater welfare therefore today education and research are central competition parameters of decisive importance regarding denmark s competitiveness the constant changes in the needs of the labour market necessitate a constant development of research and education so that they match the needs of both the business sector and the citizens for the development of skills as well as the changed requirements with regard to proficiency and com a decreasing workforce will to an ever increasing extent necessitate that our citizens are able to complete courses of education without any unnecessary waste of time and at the same time ensure the intake of new graduates to the labour market as quickly as possible an improved real coherence must be ensured between the upper secondary programmes and the higher education programmes among other things in connection with the reform of the gymna the proficiency and competences of the students within a number of central subjects must be in order the study competence should be ensured in the upper second ary programmes and educational guidance must be strengthened against the background of analyses charting and discus with the social partners it must be considered when the job functions and needs of the labour market require programmes which build on professional orientation re search affiliation as well as when there are specific needs for research based bachelor and master s degree programmes and phd programmes in this context it is of central im to determine whether the educational institutions have research and teaching competences at a level which is sufficiently high for entering into strategic alliances and networks between institutions the government will con sider the composition and supply of programmes within the short medium and long cycle higher education pro grammes respectively the subject specific requirements with regard to of research affiliation universities and medium cycle higher education institutions must be speci fied with a view to ensuring that national and international research results are utilised both in medium cycle higher edu cation programmes and in diploma programmes external evaluations must be made of those improvements in subject quality which occur through research affiliation agreements the act on medium cycle higher education which was adopted by the danish parliament in the summer of has created the basis for ensuring of the students cal and practical qualifications at a high proficiency and competence level with this act the programmes have acquired a professional bachelor s degree level and a title at the level of the bachelor programmes of the universities but which at the same time distinguishes itself through a higher degree of vocational and practice orientation a pro bachelor programme thus allows for immediate employment or direct credit in connection with further education within diploma and master s degree programmes there is to be a reform of the university most areas the overall target with the education reform is to offer a comprehensive choice of university programmes where both the quality of the teaching and the social rele vance are in focus it is the aim to reduce the dropout and ensure that even more graduates enter the labour market sooner the content and of the bachelor and master s degree programmes must be strengthened among other things with a view to meeting the future needs of both private and public companies for labour with a re search based education the content of the bachelor and master s degree pro grammes must be reformed the recruitment basis for the researcher education must be strengthened the coupling between teaching and research must be investigated and the admission requirements to the bachelor programmes must be reconsidered the individual bachelor and master s degree programmes must have a clear subject specific coherence and a socially relevant competence profile a greater focus will be placed on the bachelor programme and the master s degree programme as independent pro grammes the bachelor programme offers the possibility to enter the labour market or to continue with several dif master s degree programmes the master s degree pro grammes build upon relevant bachelor programmes the quality of the teaching and the relevance of the bachelor and master s degree programmes may be increased through a closer cooperation with sector research institutions their competences can to a greater extent be used in the pro grammes offered by the universities strategic alliances and different forms of cooperation be tween the universities themselves and between universities and sector research institutions can in general be one of the central way of improving the quality of the teaching better researcher training programmes require an increase in the number of new graduates and an increase in the range of their knowledge so that an adequate recruitment basis is ensured this is of central importance if we are to avoid a reduction in the quality proficiency and competence level of the researcher training with the point of departure in danish and foreign experi ence it must be investigated how the connection between the international quality level of the research and the level of the teaching in the programmes can be documented against this background a concept must be developed which links research and education together and ensures that the subject specific research content in the individual programmes continually reflects the latest research results in the area when admitting students with a professional bachelor edu cation to the universities master s degree programmes a balance must be ensured between the consideration for increased credit flexibility and the consideration for the academic level of the teaching and the social relevance this balance must be ensured without creating unnecessary obstacles or limitations for the students the mapping of the actual practice in the universities master s degree pro grammes when admitting students and awarding credits to a o persons with a medium cycle higher education will be useful in this respect users and recipients of graduates from the further education system for adults require a flexible system where the educa possibilities of the further education programmes for adults diploma programmes and master programmes which are at the level of the short medium and long cycle higher education programmes respectively can be adapted both to the individual s needs and to changing needs in the labour market the programmes are directed at adults with occupational experience in order to be admitted at present to the further education programmes for adults the diploma programmes or the master programmes under the further education system for adults the requirement is a minimum of years occupa experience the interpretation of this must however be reconsidered and made more flexible so that not only the number of years in the labour market but just as much the prior learning the individual has acquired is taken into consideration it may entail a reduction of the required period if a concrete clarification and assessment of the applicants prior learning form part of the admission pro in this context problems have been observed for certain groups of persons and programmes including for instance the programmes at the it universities in the following we will present a number of proposals which specifically take up the challenge and which contain initiatives which may contribute to strengthening the total educational effort within the areas of higher education and further education and continuing training short and medium cycle higher education programmes the short and medium cycle higher education programmes must be further developed with the point of departure in the needs of the recipients new interdisciplinary educa combinations will among other things be able to support an increased application orientation in the pro grammes in the short cycle higher education programmes there is to be a continued strengthening of the proficiency and com and an innovation of the programmes as well as an assurance of the interaction with the business sector among other things as a follow up to the reform where the new programmes were offered for the first time in on the background of the experience gained so far more systematic methods and procedures must be developed for a continuous assurance of the quality in particular focus will be on three areas a close dialogue between the business sector the institu tions and the ministry about the needs of the labour mar ket and the role of the programmes as a basis for a con development of the proficiency and competences upgrading of the teachers competence profile e g through job as well as in service training and further education a systematic monitoring of the relevance of the pro grammes on the one hand through clear measurable standards for proficiency competence and quality supported by the action areas in the pluri annual agree ment for higher education in this context documented via reporting from the institutions and on the other hand through requirements as to a systematic evaluation of the proficiency competences and the quality through the use of different external and internal evaluation met including self evaluation furthermore the interaction with the vocational education and training programmes must furthermore be analysed in particular the extent to which young people continue in a short cycle higher education programme upon completion of an eud programme with the reform of the medium cycle higher education pro grammes in the professional bachelor title was intro the professional bachelor programme is at the same level as the universities bachelor programmes but distin itself from these by containing both theory and practice the programme gives immediate access to per forming a job function and it also gives direct credit for further education through the diploma master s degree pro grammes before the end of the medium cycle higher education programmes will have been subject to adjustments upgrad ings or reforms with a view to reaching the professional bachelor level such as it has been the case with the health education programmes the nutritional programmes and most recently the social work programme in the process the focus will be on the possibilities of research affiliation of centres for higher education and other institutions for medium cycle higher education which offer professional bachelor pro grammes the work will among other things build on the experience gained from the action area on knowledge and development functions in the multi annual agreement whether the existing quality assurance mechanisms ex external examiner schemes and continuous evaluations are enough or whether there is a need for new tools and procedures in those instances where short cycle higher education programmes are too short a dialogue must be initiated between recipients and suppliers of medium cycle higher education programmes with a view to making an assess ment of the need for developing medium cycle higher edu cation programmes directed in particular towards the pri vate sector the universities and the recipients of the new graduates from the universities are involved in this dia logue it must be decided which new programmes there is a need for on the one hand within the ordinary education system and on the other hand within further adult educa tion as well as the diploma and master area the new pro grammes must exploit strengths in the private labour mar ket in particular within areas related to medico health information and communication technology biotech food technology etc the programmes must meet the needs of the labour market when it comes to being able to constantly meet the challenges of continuous innovation and product development in and there will be a follow up on the reforms of the short and medium cycle higher education pro gramme with the development of new programmes and adjustments and an upgrading of the proficiency and com in certain existing medium cycle higher education programmes the development of flexible education and training courses within the framework of the further education system for adults with the rapidly changing requirements and demands of the labour market for a workforce with relevant skills it is essential that education and training are offered which can improve competence and ensure the possibility of further education and continuing training for adults in the work force the first further education programmes for adults have been established these programmes will all be placed within the newly established vocational academy coopera tion so as to ensure a geographical coverage of the courses offered in close proximity to the citizens and with a region al set up which can at the same time cover the companies further education and continuing training needs in order to ensure that the needs of the users including those of the business sector are met systematic methods and procedures are to be established for a continuous docu of the achievement of the targets for the quality development and for the strengthening of the proficiency and competences the diploma programmes are directed at adults with occu experience the need for new diploma programmes will be established under consideration of existing pro grammes against the background of the development in the needs of the labour market and the demand from the individual users both the further education programmes for adults and the diploma programmes are to be organised in modules and the need for new adult education programmes will also be established under the consideration of existing pro grammes in and new programmes will be developed and offered university programmes public and private companies the research sector and the education system including the gymnasium are depen dent on graduates and researchers from the universities with qualifications at the highest scientific level the international competition in the knowledge society constitutes new challenges for danish education and re search production and the use of new knowledge are the keys to an increased growth increased employment and greater welfare therefore education and research are today central parameters of competition furthermore in the coming years there will be a need to employ many new graduates in general upper secondary education among other things due to the arrival of another generation this gives rise to new and higher demands on the univer sity programmes the content of the subjects as well as the quality and relevance must be strengthened the inter action between teaching and research and the connection between the bachelor and master s degree programmes and the researcher programme must be in focus it requires a multi pronged effort in relation to the university pro grammes strengthening of the university programmes the reform of the university programmes brings together several initiatives under the same heading regarding a a reform of the contents of the universities bachelor and master s degree programmes b improved researcher educa tion c an investigation of the link between research and education d a reassessment of the specific admission re of the bachelor programmes within certain sub jects and e cooperation on subject specific competences for teaching in general upper secondary education reform of the content of university programmes the content and relevance of the bachelor and master s degree programmes must be more apparent to students teachers and recipients the new approach to the content of the bachelor and master s degree programmes must contribute to ensuring that both the bachelor programmes and the master s degree programmes have their own subject spe identity and competence profile as well as ensuring a real progression from bachelor to master s degree thus strengthening the competence and quality of both pro grammes determining what is should be a bachelor level and what is should be a master s degree level this distribution into levels has become more topical in the light of the bologna declaration and the introduction of the levels in the new further education system for adults where in particular the diploma and master s levels are relevant focussing to a greater extent on the bachelor programme as an independent programme which may lead to em or to further studies in a master s degree pro gramme giving greater focus on the master s degree programme as an independent programme which builds on relevant bachelor programmes and which together with these can be target oriented towards different job functions independent bachelor and master s degree programmes and the deciding of their levels ensuring increased flexi and better opportunities for credit equivalence in the case of changes to the same or related programmes at another institution it is thus of decisive importance that a greater transparency is created for the students they must experience that the different elements of the study programmes are intercon to make a whole at the same it must be perfectly clear exactly which professional competences the studies will provide the students must also feel that the master s degree programmes are at a higher level than the bachelor programmes improved researcher education the graduates of the universities must primarily find employment upon completion of their studies as the employment of graduates is an efficient source of knowl edge dissemination to public and private companies the private business sector and the public research sector how ever also have an increasing need for staff with a researcher education in the form of a phd degree one of the for a high quality level in the danish researcher education is a sufficiently strong food chain from the master s degree level in several areas approx of a master s degree year group continue in a phd study pro gramme the threshold pain has thus been reached as the quality of the researcher education drops if the tran frequency exceeds this proportion one of the aims of strengthening the content of the teach ing and reducing the dropout from the bachelor and master s degree programmes is to ensure the food chain to the researcher programmes moreover in the nd term of the ministry of science technology and innovation is initiating a study of the perception of the phd pro gramme among near graduates it is among other things the intention to discover why qualified graduates opt out of the phd programme the study is furthermore intended to contribute to the continued work of making the phd pro gramme even more attractive research based teaching the central element in the programmes offered by the uni is that the teaching is based on research which among other things must ensure the highest scientific level and a continuous innovation of the theoretical and metho content of the teaching it must therefore be investigated as to how it can be possi ble to develop a new concept for an integrated evaluation of education and research the aim of initiating such a pro cess will be to document a connection between the interna quality level of the research within the individual subject areas and the level of the teaching in selected pro grammes bachelor programmes admission requirements most of the academic bachelor programmes set subject spe requirements to applicants meaning that they must have passed certain subjects at a certain level a b or c level where a is the highest level it should be considered whether these subjects should as a minimum have been passed in order for the applicants to meet the admission requirement today if a student has taken these subjects in one examina tion and has passed them then the specific admission requirement will be met irrespective of the mark obtained in the subject in question if a student has not passed for instance mathematics but has passed the general upper secondary school leaving examination as such he still meets the admission requirement for mathematics a student s study related qualifications are of great impor tance for the benefit gained from the teaching for the change of studies and dropout in particular in the first year of the bachelor programme the aim of students having improved starting level for the bachelor programme is therefore to ensure a better real sub ject specific coherence between the upper secondary pro grammes and the university programmes most university programmes have as a supplement to the requirement of a qualifying examination also subject and level specific admission requirements in a number of programmes there is thus a requirement that the applicant must have taken certain general upper secondary subjects such as mathe or english at a certain level these requirements have been established after an assess ment of what is necessary in order to be able to complete the programme the requirements are laid down centrally but the educational institutions may lay down additional requirements as to marks obtained i e either requirements with regard to average or to marks in special subjects the government is looking into whether the consideration of the fact that a student has sufficient subject specific qua justifies a demand to the effect that the applicant must have passed the subjects which are comprised by the specific admission requirement as a minimum it should be required that the average of several subjects comprised by the admission requirement should be at least being the highest possible in order to meet the specific admission requirements subject specific competence for teaching in general upper secondary education more students complete interdisciplinary university pro grammes such as nano technology physics chemistry bio logy technology and bio informatics computer science statistics mathematics molecular biology rather than the more traditional subject programmes it must be investigated how the question of these graduates subject specific competence for teaching in general upper secondary education is to be handled this must be seen in the light of the impending shortage of general upper secondary teachers in natural sciences subjects admission of graduates from a professional bachelor programme to the master s programmes when admitting graduates from a professional bachelor programme medium cycle higher education programme to the master s degree programmes of the universities a bal ance must be struck between on the one hand the con for increased credit and flexibility and the con for the proficiency and competence level on the other the aim of the admission of graduates from a professional bachelor programme medium cycle higher education pro gramme to relevant master s degree programmes is thus that graduates from a professional bachelor programme are to have direct access i e without requirements regarding sub ject specific supplements whereas graduates from medium cycle higher education programmes from before the adop tion of the act on medium cycle higher education can be required to do a subject specific supplement of up to months the ministry of education and the universities entered into an agreement in about the registration of practice for the awarding of credits in connection with the intake to master s degree programmes in accordance with the shar ing of competence this agreement is now administered by the ministry of science technology and innovation as part of the agreement credit practice is registered as far as applicants with a medium cycle higher education pro gramme are concerned as far as the universities are concer ned the procedure was initiated from the winter intake the ministry of science technology and innovation will supplement this agreement with a demand to the universi ties to the effect that they are to compile information re how graduates from a medium cycle higher educa tion programme cope in the master s degree programme in particular when it comes to completion time and dropout rates compared with persons with a research based bache lor education from a university it will subsequently be pos to use the results of this compilation of information in the development work which is taking place in the centres for higher education art and architecture programmes increased professional orientation if the growth potential of the cultural sectors which has among other things been described in a government review on the cultural and business related policies denmark s creative potential is to be realised the professionally orien ted elements in the programmes must be strengthened and the interaction between the professions and the educational institutions must be intensified improved possibilities of credit transfer and flexibility in the artistic programmes i e design music architecture etc are to make it easier to combine these programmes with more business oriented elements from other higher educa tion programmes in those programmes where it may be relevant practical training schemes are introduced and the possibility of establishing advisory business panels will be investigated the initiatives of the action plan will form part of the agreement for the programmes under the responsibility of the ministry of cultural affairs which will run for a number of years and which the minister wishes to implement the initiatives will be the point of departure for the subsequent result contracts which the ministry of cultural affairs will enter into with the educational institutions in the area the work will be initiated in introduction of a structure in accordance with the bologna declaration the artistic programmes must where it is possible in the future be or according to a structure corresponding to the bachelor and master s degree structure in the other higher education programmes it is the aim to ensure a more flex ible transparent and coherent education system with a greater liberty of choice for the individual students better coherence between the programmes and better possibilities of adaptation in relation to the demand in the labour mar ket where it is possible the artistic programmes are to be struc tured with bachelor and master s degree programmes the work with the development of the artistic programmes will continue to be organised in such a way that the pro grammes correspond as far as possible with the other higher education programmes the development of common courses of study will be initiated for students in the higher education programmes offered within the framework of the ministry of cultural affairs and other ministries strengthened research in design according to the government s report on the cultural and industrial policies denmark s creative potential the design area among others disposes of a particularly extensive growth potential if this potential is to be realised it is of decisive importance that the danish research in the design area be strengthened research based design education is a prerequisite for ensuring a structure and full credits and flexibility for the design programmes so that they follow the international development and meet the needs of the business sector research in the field of design must be strengthened and coordinated the ministry of cultural affairs must set aside more funds for design research and the cooperation be tween the design schools and the schools of architecture on design research must be extended it is the aim to make it possible in the course of the coming years to offer research based design education in denmark geographical distribution and more specialised professional environments in a time of rapid professional development the distribution of the artistic educational institutions represents a risk that the professional environments become so small that it may hamper the competence level obtained in the programmes in order to maintain a high competen ce level and a fruitful study environment the division of labour between the institutions must be increased so as to ensure bigger and more specialised professional environ ments hereby it will both be possible to improve the com level and maintain the geographical distribution of the institutions and at the same time ensure that there is as far as possible a balance between the supply and the demand in the area the distribution of the subjects between the institutions must be revised and adjusted with a view to ensuring a high proficiency and competence level in the individual educa environments and a dimension that is in accordance with the needs of the labour market raising of it level the programmes under the ministry of cultural affairs are largely directed towards the professions of the information and media sector in order to ensure a high proficiency and competence level in these programmes and an immediate desire on the part of the graduates to participate in practical training it is a decisive prerequisite that the programmes have it competences and production equipment which is state of the art in relation to the professions in which the graduates will subsequently seek employment funds are set aside for investments in state of the art it competences and production equipment for the pro grammes under the ministry of cultural affairs improved further education and continuing training courses in order to ensure that lifelong learning is also available within the programmes under the ministry of cultural affairs it should be made possible to pursue further educa tion and continuing training courses within the artistic pro grammes it is the aim to improve the graduate s com in order to improve their employment prospects and meet the demands of the professions for new com funds are set aside for the development establishment and operation of further education and continuing training within the programmes under the ministry of cultural affairs maritime programmes coherence and flexibility in the maritime area there is a tradition for establishing programmes to meet any need in the industry furthermore the time and structure related framework is used as a man parameter in connection with credit transfer be tween the programmes there is therefore a relatively exten sive supply of programmes the duration of which has been extended in step with new requirements from the industry and credit transfer across programmes has become more dif since the programmes have been subject to major re structuring instead of central content management with focus on the syllabus and examinations target and frame work management has now been introduced all pro grammes are now described through aims and targets thus showing the professional competences of the individual programmes target management thus makes it possible to look at prior learning to a greater extent than at time and structure and hereby it becomes possible to create a better coherence between the programmes and more effective courses in the ministry of business and economic affairs will initiate a review of the total package of maritime pro grammes with a view to identifying core competences and finding ways of reducing the duration of the programmes this will thus form the basis for adaptations of the pro grammes so that they can be offered in more coherent courses with the possibility for all categories of students to withdraw from the courses at a given time or to continue with further education in the necessary adjustments will be decided quality measurement and structure in the future all the maritime educational institutions will become private self governing institutions receiving taxi meter grants in line with the other areas of education the institutions will themselves be responsible for all planning implementation and evaluation of the programmes and will document the achievement of targets in a formal quality system with external auditing the high degree of of the responsibility for education and evaluations creates a need for management by incentive where both the quantity and quality of the production of the educational institution will have an influ ence on the total grant awarded when grants are awarded both in relation to the production of graduates and to the relevant professional qualifications of the graduates the incentive will be maintained so that the institutions pro vide education in relation to the relevant needs first and foremost this form of management requires a rele vant indicator for the quality of the programme in the course of the ministry of economic and business affairs will identify indicators which are to form part of a new quality index in the possibility of making part of the institutions grants dependent on the index will be investigated academic further education possibilities in maritime denmark around people are employed at sea whereas approx are employed on land more and more jobs on land require education at an academic level the maritime programmes are of a duration of years of which the longest in level correspond to a medium cycle higher education programme experience shows that a rela large proportion of the graduates seek employment on land there is still an increasing demand and a desire for the possibility of further education for these persons up to academic level so that they can continue a career on land instead of having to start all over again so far when it comes to further education it has been diffi cult not to say impossible to obtain recognition of a mari time qualification in connection with further education it is probably due to this that maritime staff leave the profes sion as they have limited career prospects due to the lack of further education possibilities a consequence of this may among other things be that the profession loses ex perience and knowledge instead of maintaining a strong body of competences a basis for academic further education possibilities must be created for persons with a maritime background in the ministry of economic and business affairs will look into the possibility of academic credit for maritime programmes and the establishment of a master programme in relation to the maritime profession in this connection the financial framework conditions will be clarified the study is to form the basis for a decision about necessary initiatives easier access to oriented qualifying adult education within the maritime professions there is a large group of adults with a low level of educational attainment in order to ensure these persons continued employment in relation to the needs of the industry a wide range of target oriented education and training courses must be organised in the near future and they must be organised on conditions which make them attractive to the target group the maritime programmes have several qualifying educa tion courses of short duration which are all organised with young people as the target group in order to ease the access of the adult group to further education there is a need to organise the education and training courses offered in rela tion to them in particular with the right financial support conditions adult education grand in danish svu a package of further education courses for adults is to be organised including qualifying courses in connection with the review of the maritime programmes in the course of the financial aspects of the support schemes must be in the course of the ministry of economic and business affairs will organise the establishment of the initiatives which have been decided basic and further education in the health area the following topics in relation to improvements of the education system in the health area must be taken up an increased all round effort of recruitment and educa tion of more students for the many health education pro grammes where there is or where in the short or long term will be a shortage of staff in the health sector a greater emphasis must be laid on management according to need and occupational relevance in the recruitment situation and proposals should be made for better educa guidance and study supporting measures among other things with a view to countering dropout and the making of wrong choices maintenance and strengthening of the practical training in the health education programmes and a closer coopera tion between theory and practice in the institutions a broader effort in the basic programmes to ensure among other things the health staff s further use of it for diag treatment communication etc a continued strengthening of the specialist doctor s area including documentation and clarification of results and effects of the specialist doctors reform programme through continuous evaluations and quality measurement and development assurance of continued further education and continuing training for other groups with health qualifications e g nurses cross cutting initiatives the government wishes to improve and strengthen the edu cation system over a broad front parallel with the above mentioned education specific conditions the government therefore wishes to implement a number of cross cutting initiatives which concern all the areas of education improved cross sector guidance an essential action area in the effort to ensure better educa tion is improved educational and vocational guidance there is a need to create more coherence in and coordina tion of the guidance given in connection with the transi tion between basic school and upper secondary education and between upper secondary education and higher educa tion the effort in this area must ensure a better and more efficient exploitation of resources improved guidance must also discourage wrong choices and dropout the guidance must be target oriented in relation to those young people who have the greatest needs there is to be a better coordination of guidance in the adult education area and there is a need for a of the guidance counsellors these needs have most recently been men in the report on cross sector guidance follow up to b as well as in the oecd s country note on guidance in denmark in order to ensure a coherent cross sector guid ance the government will investigate in more detail the institutional and organisational framework of this guidance the guidance offered will be made more transparent and accessible to the individual citizen the access to relevant guidance and information about programmes educational institutions job prospects on completion of the individual programmes and about the expected employment pro spects will be made easier the citizens will have a better basis on which to make choices regarding education and training better access to relevant information is to become a reality through an increased use of it in guidance an increased use of it will mean a possibility to move resources over to groups with a need for special guidance here it is a ques tion of young people who need close individual and per sonal guidance and counselling which will motivate and qualify them to be able to choose education and training courses or employment an increased use of it will also allow for computerised registration for the upper secondary and higher education programmes it is also being considered whether or not to change the composition of the national council for educational and vocational guidance rue and the tasks and resources of the council finally a new guidance counsellor course will be established which can be used for a number of guidance schemes a proposal is expected to be presented to parliament in the autumn of strengthening of natural sciences in the entire education system the intake to the technical natural sciences programmes is too low children and young people have a too limited interest in the subject area and in international studies danish young people score poorly in these subjects this necessitates a unified and target oriented effort in order to strengthen the natural sciences subjects in the entire educa tion system the following initiatives will therefore be implemented an analysis group is to draw up proposals for a moderni sation of the natural sciences teaching in the entire edu cation system with emphasis on core competences and teacher qualifications a conference on natural sciences will be held in connec tion with denmark s eu presidency with a view to cing international cooperation the role of the business sector in relation to education is to be strengthened and made visible the focus of atten tion should be on cooperation with the business sector and on the possibilities of sponsoring e g in connection with the modernisation of class rooms a survey should be made of the development of the teachers competences and need of continuing training with special emphasis on the subject of science in the lower school classes the development of a new course concept including it based courses and programmes for course providers the development of new better and inspiring teaching material including it based teaching material the strengthening of the natural sciences research and education through a closer interaction with the relevant sector research the establishment of interdisciplinary research schools in which private companies participate the development of new scientific bachelor and master s degree programmes with a high intake and completion rate all initiatives are to be implemented in an evaluation group will compile experience on a continuous basis and assess the achievement of targets greater of the programmes if denmark is to be among the leaders in the global know ledge society it is of the utmost importance that danes have the necessary cultural competences to enable them to cope in an international knowledge based labour market the education system must to a greater extent be able to deliver the relevant competences which are currently in demand with students and companies at the same time it must to a greater extent be possible to get prior learning acquired abroad recognised in denmark a strengthening of the international dimension in educa tion among other things comprises the following topics openness guidance and information regarding the supply of education internationally the bologna cooperation and the coming cooperation in the field of vocational education and training lifelong learning in order to achieve the government s target that danish education and training courses are able to match the best in the world denmark has to take active part in international quality development evaluation and benchmarking denmark must continue to take part in and to a greater degree make use of the results of international studies such as the oecd reviews and pisa in the eu denmark is work ing on the follow up to the target report which is to im prove the quality and the efficiency of education systems in the eu the focus is in particular on an improvement of the basic skills proficiency competences and it knowledge in addition denmark should take advantage of the oppor to be inspired by international cooperation through good examples from other countries of how education and training can be organised international cooperation often leads to the result that when it comes to one s own values and functions they are seen in a new constructive tive a higher degree of international mobility for students teachers and employed people can contribute actively to giving the individual citizen a better education and to en denmark to cope better in the knowledge society if danish students are to benefit to a maximum degree from international education and training opportunities it must to a greater extent be possible to get results and credits transferred from education received at recognised foreign educational institutions danish educational institutions must also be willing to receive foreign students the institu tions must also be encouraged to enter into strategic ces with foreign institutions in particular in cooperation with the danish exchange organisation and to parti on a continuous basis in international cooperation this requires more and better available information on edu cation systems in other countries including the use of the so called ects system european credit transfer system and the diploma supplement etc the bologna process concerning higher education is pro both on european and on a national level the most important objectives descriptions of educa structures the diploma supplement and ects have been fulfilled by denmark furthermore in the areas of vocational education and training and labour market train ing an initiative has been taken to create the basis for a strengthened european cooperation on the mutual recogni tion of vocational qualifications and competences good foreign language competences are not only an abso lute necessity in the labour market of the knowledge socie ty they are also a requirement especially if danish students are to gain access to a rapidly expanding international edu environment the students must have a command of english at a high level both oral and written english so that they are able to communicate appropriately in addi tion there is often a need to be able to express oneself in at least one more main language as far as the gymnasium programmes are concerned the government would like pupils to have the possibility to acquire competences by completing part of their education abroad and by doing it in such a way that the study visit abroad may form part of their danish programme without any waste of time various possibilities will be studied in order to establish a model for the general upper secondary programmes which among other things builds on the voca and organisational experience gained in the previous vocational college model the oriented general upper secondary and htx programmes previously used a model whereby special groups spent a semester of their danish programme in a school abroad the teaching was organised according to danish education regulations and in this way the study visit abroad formed part of the usual year programme the scheme required user pay ment from the pupils for travel and accommodation in the government will present a model for all four types of general upper secondary programmes by which the pupils can complete part of the programme abroad improved recognition of prior learning in the education system denmark has as part of the strategy for lifelong learning taken the first step towards the recognition of results of non formal learning with its further education system for adults so far the issue has been regarded from the tive of the education system but there is now a greater need for it to be perceived and dealt with on the basis of the needs of the citizens companies and the different trades in the short term methods must be developed for an indi assessment of competences in connection with the basic adult education programmes a common con cept for the assessment of competences must be developed which can be used as a replacement for both individual assessment of competences ikv and individual tion of competences ika which are laid down by law the transparent and coherent system of assessment of prior learning must be used on a broad scale in relation to the labour market training programmes the adult vocational training programmes and the basic adult education pro grammes furthermore methods must be developed in order to assess the suitability of relevant occupational experience as a basis for access to higher levels in the further education systems for adults in the somewhat longer term the following areas should be investigated and prioritised with emphasis on quality the introduction of general access for applicants who do not have the formal qualifications to have their corre prior learning assessed and recognised the shortening of courses in the ordinary programmes on the basis of the use of non formal competences the possibility of registering for examinations or having diplomas issued exclusively on the basis of non formal competences the definition and description of of known com from the education system the establishment of documentation schemes in working life in an interaction with companies educational plan ning the development work will be initiated in the imple will be initiated in increased flexibility and better credit transfer possibilities in the programmes a flexible education system and good credit transfer systems constitute a basis enabling young people to move rapidly through the educational programmes and thus avoiding double qualifications in this way one can ensure the citi zens possibilities of lifelong learning the education system must be able to live up to the recipients expectations of flexible employees with relevant qualifications and compe for the programmes under the ministry of educa tion among others it must be made possible that compe including admission competences can be acquired in different ways which may vary from individual to indi in this context also the work with credit transfer must be given higher priority with a view to obtaining flexi and increased mobility in the education system nationally as well as internationally in upper secondary education there is a need to improve the possibilities of obtaining credit transfer both in general and in oriented upper secondary education therefore a new ministerial order on credit transfer must be issued with broader possibilities of getting recognition of previously completed subjects or parts the new order executive must build on the principle that pupils who have already completed passed the same subject at least at the same level have a legal claim of recognition as in the past but without a schematic list of what are the same subjects pupils who have only completed parts of a subject must have the right to have their wish of recogni tion dealt with pupils who have already completed a subject or a course which in accordance with the aims of the programme can replace another subject or another course are entitled to have their wish of recognition dealt with by the school the school must attach its subject specific grounds for making the decision in question the basis for the school s treat ment of the pupils wishes regarding recognition must appear in the new order on credit transfer in the form of a description of the procedure it must lay down require ments both to the school and the pupil and establish a number of criteria for when it is possible to award credits these criteria must build on the fact that the school s assessment of the competences must be seen in relation to the aims stated for the programme in question in higher education a project has been initiated for the mapping of practice when it comes to credit transfer the aim of the project is to identify possible barriers for credit transfer and to propose possible solutions in connection with the completed reforms of the short and medium cycle higher education programmes horizontal credit i e credit for the same programme completed at dif institutions all over the country has been established through formal rules formal rules regarding credit transfer also exist in university education programmes the principle of deciding centrally regarding horizontal cre dits will be systematically pursued in connection with coming reforms reviews of existing and development of new higher education programmes the credit transfer pos must furthermore be strengthened in those cases where a student has interrupted a study programme or com a study programme and wished to start a new one a new executive ministerial order on credit transfer in upper secondary education will be issued in for the higher education area a situation report will be drawn up in on the credit transfer practice in the institutions and this will be followed up on in improved educational achievement through the use of it in the past few years the educational sector has invested significant sums in it both in equipment and in the con training of teachers good progress has been made within the different programmes when it comes to learning to use it the next steps will be to reach the result that it becomes the pupils students personal tool so that they can use it for learning an effective pedagogical use of it will in addition to the possibility of strengthening the level of the teaching also give a better possibility of organising the teaching and getting better access to teaching at a high proficiency and competence level it also provides easy access to the significant learning resources that can be found locally nationally and internationally it will con tribute to strengthening the level of the teaching subject to the necessary quality assurance of the contents through an increased differentiation it must support indi learning both for strong and weak pupils all users of the education system must gradually learn to use it at examinations the experience gained up till now with it based examination papers must form the basis for the elaboration of new examination forms apart from including a continued integration of it in the teaching the initiatives should consist in net based know ledge sharing systems for both administrative and cal purposes as well as the development of flexible e learn ing through pilot projects and the dissemination of exam ples of best practice furthermore the government will promote the develop ment of internet based teaching materials and focus on the use of it at examinations and in particular on the develop ment of new examination forms which are to take advan tage of the potential of the information technologies in both the content and form of the examinations the focus must moreover be on the head teachers use of it in an offensive development strategy finally a strengthening of the e learning possibilities must provide a much greater flex in the supply of programmes independent of time and place the work will be initiated in danish for adult foreigners greater efficiency and flexibility must be ensured in the teaching of danish as a second language to adult foreigners against the background of the government s target of a significant increase in the employment of foreigners the government wishes to optimise the municipalities integra tion of foreigners with a view to a more rapid affiliation to the labour market and self support it is therefore proposed that the teaching of danish and its financing is made more efficient among other things by placing a larger part of the teaching in companies the danish teaching at the language centres must not hin der the foreigners in getting a job the important thing is coherence between teaching and the practical use of the language at the place of work it is among other things re that the planning and organisation of the teaching be carried out more and be individually adapted to the teaching needs of the individual and the company at the same time it is a prerequisite that the many years of experience with the learning of danish both basic general danish and technical language is maintained and devel oped quality and proficiency must be ensured and developed through an interaction between on the one hand the par s practical use of the language and on the other hand the teaching there is a basic assumption in the proposal that greater motivation and the opportunity to acquire danish will be provided by sending foreigners out to a danish work place together with danish colleagues who will make an effort to integrate them this makes certain demands on danish language teachers and the language schools to establish teaching in the com panies the danish language teachers must be able to com bine teaching in general language proficiency and teaching in technical language in the company and perform con evaluations of the language proficiency as well as prepare the individual for the final centrally organised language examinations cooperation is to be established between companies on joint language classes the establish ment of teaching in smaller classes and greater use of it and net based teaching a working group has been set up which is to come up with proposals by the end of on how the teaching of danish can become more efficient entrepreneurship culture in the education system innovation and entrepreneurship can contribute signifi to economic growth in denmark a positive attitude towards innovation and entrepreneurship is therefore of central importance to the labour market the education system must contribute to creating a positive attitude towards a culture which encourages innovation and entre this must be carried out openly and in a dia logue with companies and organisations etc the openness may for instance be created through exchange schemes between educational institutions and private companies project cooperation mentor schemes the involvement of business people in the evaluation of work carried out by pupils and increased research in entrepreneurship and inno etc the entrepreneurship policy in the area of education is anchored in the special competences of the individual areas of education including the subject specific and pedagogical methods which are characteristic of the field the new initiatives in the primary and secondary areas must not be in the form of actual entrepreneurship teach ing but in upper secondary education they may be in the form of project work or other forms of learning and teach ing which may encourage the pupils independence initia tive and future ability to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship projects the teaching may be related to everyday issues preferably typical of the companies in the local community in order to further inform and offer guidance about the possibilities of becoming an entrepre neur a number of visits will be organised to business and technical colleges in the school year in the field of higher education development work is being carried out with a view to increasing the information con the application of research results for business pur poses as well as a strengthening of the interaction between the business sector and the educational institutions in the university field new educational courses within entrepre and innovation are expected to be initiated and they will be based on a greater research effort in the area these efforts must however not be too narrowly defined there is entrepreneur potential to be found within all groups of pupils at all levels and within all programmes and with a target oriented effort it will be possible to de entrepreneurial skills in the autumn the government will publish an action plan entitled more entrepreneurs which among other things will deal with the area of educa tion the action plan is an initiative under the govern ment s growth strategy determined growth better institutions for better education in order to meet the government s expectations for better education in the areas covered by the ministry of educa tion it is necessary that the educational institutions live up to the accepted standards of proficiency and competences that they make an efficient and target oriented use of resources and that they are financially sustainable as well as regionally accessible better institutions are therefore a corner stone of the government s educational policy of better education in continuation of the presentation of this report on better education the ministry of education will issue a special publication on better educational institutions which will make an in depth account of the particular institution poli cy initiatives in relation to the ministry s educational insti the educational institutions must be strengthened by improving the basic prerequisites structures and framework conditions and by improving the possibility of a better and more target oriented use of the resources including output management incentives the institutions must have free dom with responsibility together the initiatives are to give the educational institu tions prerequisites tools responsibility and a degree of free dom so that they are able to meet the new requirements for increased quality and competence a consistent tion must be carried out in order to create a coherent and development oriented management concept with focus on principles of self management and which includes a further development of the financial management a strengthening of the institutional structure in particular in the vocational ly oriented area of education a realisation of the require ments for greater transparency and openness a strength ened basis for an optimal use of the resources a special use of teaching resources as well as management development the initiative better institutions for better education amplifies the following institution policy initiatives further development of the financial management system so that it will to a greater extent promote the objectives of the institutional structure and contribute to the develop ment of the quality of the programmes and further de of the system regional educational institutions with increased self management adaptation of institutional structures and regulation of courses supplied with a view to creating re strong flexible and less vulnerable educational institutions a one stranded institutional structure will among other things be established between amu centres and vocational colleges and the vocational academies short cycle higher education programmes will be further developed transparency and openness output indicators further development of output indicators in order to render them visible to stakeholders as an incentive to improve institu and educational quality pedagogical methods and flexible organisation of the work the teachers must to a greater extent focus on the teaching of the individual pupil and on those skills which the individual pupils should acquire through his or her course of education this requires a flexible organisation of the work and a chance to use a broad spectrum of pedagogical methods good management those responsible for the running of an institution must be able to make use of all necessary management tools demands must therefore be made on them when it comes to education policy management pedagogical management staff policy management financial management and administrative management
