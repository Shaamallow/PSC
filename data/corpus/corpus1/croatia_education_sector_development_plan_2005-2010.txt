contribution to the work on this document IVFOREWORD The Century of Knowledge which we have entered the globalization process new scientific discoveries new technologies and forms of communication the time of interwoven diverse and changing values are all factors which impact the education system as well Looking at education development trends in Europe and throughout the world Croatia has also recognized the need to transform its education system to meet the new requirements The Education Sector Development Plan is a strategic development document adopted by the Croatian Government on June The plan is based on a comprehensive systemic educational framework and was discussed by numerous social experts scientists and other partners over the past few years A particular strength of the document is its transparency regarding the needed improvements during the period of its implementation The aim of the Development Plan is to direct educational policy to improve the education system so that it is a system that includes legal aspects human resources financial matters scientific aspects and expertise The educational system should provide education that aims to benefit all those participating in it as well as society as a whole This collective effort should increase the quality of education that will cater to the needs of local culture the economy and a society based on knowledge and democratic principles and ensure the right to education for all The starting point is to define the content and activities which would contribute to the development of a better quality more accessible more flexible and effective educational system that would create intellectual and working human capital as the key asset of the Croatian state The Croatian educational system provides educational services on the following levels pre school primary secondary and tertiary and an adult education system Special attention is given to the principle of lifelong learning with the aim of including adults and the unemployed in flexible educational and training programs to prepare them for active participation in the labor market We are faced today with major challenges which affect the development of the educational system a declining population changes in the economy aimed at manufacturing and the service industry the need to rapidly acquire new knowledge skills and competencies required in contemporary manufacturing and non economic activities the need for lifelong education and the process of accession to the European Community In the following text the Development Plan VSpecific priority areas in the Development Planthrough include Improving teaching and learning in schools developing knowledge and skills by training teachers and improving their social and monetary status Improving working conditions in schools and upgrading school equipment Developing the habit of lifelong learning according to market needs Increasing the use of information and communications technology Strengthening the role of schools in preventing socially unacceptable behavior Encouraging varied means of helping pupils with their learning and extra curricular activities and creating an atmosphere which makes the school a learning community in which close and respectful relationships are built Improving management of educational institutions and introducing a system of monitoring and external evaluating education Rationalizing and decentralizing the educational system Increasing direct support to regional development Increasing family participation the local community and other partners in improving the educational system Innovative approaches to the educational process and harmonization with EU programs on all levels Harmonizing the Croatian higher education system with the European system Linking the higher education and science systems Strengthening national and cultural values Strengthening the awareness of belonging to the European cultural circle These and other activities should galvanize the quality of the overall educational system make it accessible to all and improve the education and permanent professional training of teachers in Croatia The Development Plan will be implemented within the existing funding structure of the Government of the Republic of Croatia supported by a loan from the World Bank EU pre accession funds for candidate countries and other sources Therefore it is of paramount importance for the preparedness of the state to increase funding for education in order to get closer to European standards The Government s proposed measures to improve education and training especially with regard to improving the educational infrastructure and adjusting secondary education so that it responds to the needs of young people will require more efficient allocation and the rational use of financial resources The implementation of the Development Plan is based on the Annual Development Plan godi nji plan aktivnosti developed by the Ministry of Science Education and Sports in order to conduct regular monitoring of the plan s implementation The evaluation of this Development Planwill be conducted in and VICONTENTS FOREWORD

globalization and the stabilization process Croatia is undergoing economic restructuring and the pressures of competition demographic factors as well as the need for modernization and the development of a knowledge based society and economy the need arises for effective changes in planning the development of the education system To ensure continuity new educational policies rely on preserving the fundamental values of the Croatian society and previous educational documents and successful practices while also utilizing new guidelines and activities in order to develop the Croatian educational system in line with the state of the art standards of Europe and the rest of the world The provision of educational services is still to a large extent in the jurisdiction of state and local authorities However as a result of democratic changes private education institutions training institutions as well as the civil sector have become parts of the educational process The level of education in Croatia is below the international average in many respects Specifically according to the census percent of the population has not completed any form of schooling percent has not completed primary schooling percent of the population has only primary schooling and percent of the total population holds some form of secondary school education Meanwhile percent of the population has completed two year college programs percent of the population holds Bachelor Master Ph D degrees while the level of education for percent of the population is unknown It is important to note that this data refer to all people older than Central Bureau of Statistics Population census http www dzs hr Hrv Popis popis htm Chart The Percentage of the Population Over the Age of According to the Level of Education Completed Data on participation levels in the educational system range from an almost full inclusion rate of children in primary education to according to European standards a below average participation rate in the tertiary education system According to official data participation in primary education is at percent Approximately percent of primary school graduates enroll in secondary education and approximately percent of secondary school students complete their studies on time During the academic year a total of students or percent of youth aged to enrolled in tertiary education According to official statistics only percent of the students completed their university studies and only percent of the students graduated within the expected time A part of the legacy of the Yugoslav educational system is the multiple shift arrangement in schools According to data of the Ministry of Science Education and Sports for the school year percent of elementary schools have double shifts while percent have triple shifts According to the same data the proportion of high schools that have double shifts is percent According to estimates by the Ministry of Science Education and Sports percent of primary school pupils and percent of secondary school pupils attend multiple shift schools This is obviously an obstacle to developing schools as whole day learning centers and it also makes teachers professional development in schools more difficult See Table p Also regional differences in the level of education of the population are most visible in the number of illiterate people in a certain region in comparison to the total illiteracy rate in Croatia Specifically counties such as Po ega Slavonija Zadar ibenik Knin Vukovar Srijem Sisak Moslavina and Lika Senj that are at a below average level of development have an illiteracy rate higher than percent However the total number of illiterate people is not much greater than in other countries A much greater problem is the large number of adults who did not finish or did not even start primary school as well as a considerable number of people who have only completed a secondary school education The high and long term level of unemployment of those who have completed secondary education demands the re examination of secondary education and its adjustment to the needs of the market In terms of the number of adults participating in primary school education no systematically gathered data exist but there are some on adult secondary education For example during the school year adults attended some type of verified secondary school program of which around percent of them are younger than Approximately participants earned certificates upon completion of training programs and additional training The quality of education is in principle guaranteed by a high standard of teacher training It is therefore particularly important to pay attention to teachers education and continuing professional development Table The Structure of Teacher Training Levels in Croatia The level of education of teachers does not always correspond to the actual knowledge skills and competencies of teachers This discrepancy can be ascribed to poor programs and uneven implementation of undergraduate studies as well as inadequate and unmonitored professional training The unemployment experienced by young people makes it difficult for them to take an active role in society Compulsory education lasts eight years which means that students leave the educational system at the age of about Their prospects of finding work are minimal considering the state of the economy and the unemployment level Therefore special attention should be given to transforming vocational schools which should offer varied educational and training possibilities so that they are in accordance with the needs of employers and the real labor market Data on Adult Education Birotehnika CDO Zagreb Education staff data base Ministry of Science Education and Sports The need to increase investment in education is clear in light of the high standards of other well established education systems with which we are seeking to align Croatian education Financing and distributing funds for educational priorities will be worked out following an analysis and monitoring of educational system needs at all levels When speaking of financing education in Croatia the question arises of how to distribute financial resources to the various sub systems in education pre school primary secondary and tertiary education In addition the process of educational funding must take into account various changes in the country s demography as well as the fact that the size of the school age population is declining This has important implications for human capital and budgetary allocations for education Demographic changes are not uniform across all regions of the country so the financing of education must take these regional variations into account CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT The Impact of Social and Economic Changes on Education The role of the education system is to create and develop intellectual professionally competent and humanistic oriented human capital that will benefit the country and the common good Education has a crucial role in equipping all children young people and adults with equal opportunities when entering society and the labor market regardless of their social background The educational system now faces the challenge of promoting and maintaining national cultural and humanistic values which develop a sense of community acceptance and tolerance of differences solidarity responsibility for sustainable development as well as active citizenship and the development of democratic society as a whole A precondition for the active involvement of people in the economy and a society based on knowledge is the acquisition of a basic level of linguistic scientific mathematical technological and social education Excessive differentiation in education and changing the economic and social environment could lead to fewer possibilities for continuing education and the exclusion of individuals and groups from the education system One of the greatest risks of the Croatian educational system is precisely the question of adjusting to rapidly changing social needs Accession to the European Union creates new challenges for the Croatian educational system such as attaining greater levels of quality flexibility mobility and responsiveness to changes in Croatian society and the European Community The European Union policy of labor force mobility may result in young people leaving the country especially those with higher education brain drain In order to avoid these risks concerted action by the entire social and political community is necessary One of the prerequisites of active involvement in an information based society is equipping people with the skills to use information and communication technology ICT in everyday life All education systems must face the challenges of an information based society in which the use of information and communication technologies opens a wide range of possibilities for sustainable learning opportunities Considering the fact that ICT has had a significant influence on the work environments and everyday life of people and has become an indispensable skill middle term and long term education strategies must contain measures for expanding the use of ICT contributing to the democratization of the learning process and advancing the concept of flexible and individualized education for all Demographic Trends The population of Croatia is predicted to decline by percent between and going from people in to in Thus Croatia s demographic structure will change radically primarily through predicted declines in the younger age groups By it is envisioned that the age group will decrease by about percent This trend will continue after Table Projected Number of School age Children and Youth The demand for well educated citizens will increase with the emergence of the knowledge based economy At the same time some young people enroll at but never complete secondary or higher education while others do not continue with their education after leaving secondary school This problem demands specific measures within the education sector for pupils nearing the end of their secondary education Such measures should keep them in the system and increase their employment opportunities The four principal ways in which the education system can respond to this problem are To increase the number of young people who complete secondary education To develop a system of professional information and counseling services available to these groups as part of a lifelong professional orientation program To promote the participation of adults with only primary education in adult education programs To invest in improving the quality of learning at all educational levels The shortage of workers will have a negative influence on economic growth The expected difficulties stemming from limited access to the labor market due to demographic developments point to the need for the improved efficacy and performance of the education system as well as the need to allow young people to obtain the necessary knowledge and skills in order to find employment after leaving primary and secondary education This assumes the increased involvement in education programs and training by adults World Bank Edstats Changes in the Labor Market The need for knowledge will increase It is estimated that the fastest growth in labor demand will take place in the intellectual services arena especially through the burgeoning information and communication technology sector ICT The most dramatic drop in labor demand is expected in the lower level education workforce Many jobs will require proficiency in modern technology The structure of occupations will increasingly rely on the need for lifelong learning The basic common competencies of obligatory and professional training will be developed according to European standards For the obligatory education system as well as professional training several common goals are emphasized acquiring language and communication skills improving information technology and communications literacy understanding mathematics natural sciences foreign languages social studies and entrepreneurship learning how to learn and general culture In case of rapid social and economic change and therefore changes in the labor market it is necessary to align and link pre school primary secondary and higher education as well as adult education and training The younger generations need to be prepared to work in challenging conditions so it is important to assess together with social and economic partners the required profiles of the emerging labor force Regional Development In the long term better education along with favorable changes in the economy aligned with labor market needs is expected to contribute to a reduction in the unemployment rate It is also expected that economic development will be encouraged as part of the revitalization of the demographically declining areas Regional differences in the Republic of Croatia will be eased by the planned implementation of measures that should contribute to balancing underdeveloped areas with the developed areas and provide both with social links e g long distance learning The EU is also dealing with regional differences as it implements its own guidelines and policies The Republic of Croatia will make use of designated EU funding to promote and develop economic policies and strengthen the social cohesion of less developed areas World Bank Edstats National Competitiveness Council Recommendations for Increasing Croatia s Competitiveness Education for Growth and Development http nvk multilink hr english publications NVK Recommendations pdf Financing Education The development of education in Croatia will depend on the material investment that the Republic of Croatia is able to undertake In public expenditure accounted for over percent of the GDP which is a very high percentage compared to EU accession and candidate countries It is estimated that financing a more thorough and sustainable improvement of the educational system requires significant funding of which the most urgent emergency increase should amount to more than percent of the GDP The Ministry of Science Education and Sportsprovides the largest financial support to the education sector In addition to MOSES other ministries and local government also allocate funds for education Thus when estimating the share of public education expenditures in GDP terms it is important to indicate all sources of financing in order to have a full picture For example the total budget of the Ministry of Science Education and Sports accounted for percent of the GDP in If we add the expenditures of the Ministry of Science Education and Sports to expenditures made by other central ministries and at the local level public education expenditures amounted to percent of the GDP in During the planning period the financing of education requires the monitoring of the actual share of funds in the State budget as well as estimates for potentially increasing the total amount of funds During the planning period it is necessary to define the financing of the education sector also by external funding sources Funds for the education sector will steadily increase in order to approach allocations in European countries In order to ease the burden on state spending and include society in the education process businesses individuals and specialized employment agencies that wish to speed up the employment process can contribute to professional and vocational education Globalization and Accession to the EU The globalization of the economy means a more definitive division of labor and cooperation at the global level as well as growing competition changes in the employment structure and changes in the required knowledge and skills Student and labor mobility are expected to increase with globalization These changes will also affect the education system Thus taking into consideration the increasing opportunity for student mobility it is necessary to retain the participants in educational services at education and training institutions by offering them applicable lessons and high quality teaching In recent years the European Union has substantially intensified its activities in the Ministry of Science Education and Sports Statistics Department education and research sectors although the real authority in these matters lies mainly with the member states Through the exchange of good educational practices in fields such as teacher training basic foreign language skills information and communication technology finance management and counseling and informal learning and teaching with performance monitored by agreed indicators and benchmarks a coherent education and research sector is emerging in Europe Meanwhile Croatia has to define its own profile in its own key knowledge areas International competition for talented pupils and students and teachers and researchers is gaining momentum Croatia must provide its own educational and research systems that enable it to cooperate with others Europe is pooling educational resources with a view toward strengthening its impact on the global level and Croatia will soon be measured against the high standards of advanced EU countries Accession to the European Union includes the assumption that Croatia has its own educational system and its quality is approaching the level of those in the member states Globalization and the resulting inter dependence of the countries of the world has been accepted as a process in which national identity and national interests are not lost Therefore a strategic document was prepared as the starting point for changes to the education system This document was the Declaration on Knowledge Croatia Based on Knowledge and the Application of Knowledge by the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts of The Development Plan is also founded on the principles and goals of the Lisbon Declaration Education and Training until of This declaration calls on member countries to modernize their education systems to allow the EU to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world In the same way the Development Planalso relies on the Copenhagen Declaration by the European ministers responsible for vocational education The plan is also influenced by the Bologna Declaration which relates to the establishment of Europe as a unified area of higher education by which is of crucial importance for promoting the territorial and professional mobility of citizens and their search for employment The Republic of Croatia signed the Bologna Declarationin http europa eu int comm education index en html http www hazu hr Deklaracija pdf http europa eu int growthandjobs index en htm http europa eu int comm education copenhagen copenahagen decla ration en pdf http www mzos hr Download BOLOGNA DECLARATION pdf PRIORITIES IN EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT It is of great importance for the Croatian education sector to be founded on clear priorities and clearly defined targets This chapter describes the four key development priorities namely Improving the quality and effectiveness of education Stimulating the continuing professional training of teachers and other education sector employees Developing strategies for improving the management and efficiency of the education system and Promoting education for social cohesion and economic growth and development Improving the Quality and Efficiency of Education In order to improve the education system particular attention has been given to updating the content and teaching methods used in schools as well as evaluating the achievements and the continual professional training of teachers A specific aim relates to the decentralization of education management The entire education system will be strengthened in terms of what it offers and implementation will closely follow the educational standards of the European Union The quality of learning and teaching will be improved in pre school primary and secondary schools as the basis for lifelong learning The practice of acquiring factual or a broad range of encyclopedic knowledge will be replaced by the development of comprehension skills problem solving and the practical application of knowledge that contribute to the quality of life of students in the modern world In order to modernize education in the broadest sense of the word information and communication technology ICT will be used to provide for lifelong learning for all those interested especially those in preschool primary secondary and higher education and in the adult education system In work will begin on the systematic implementation of a project entitled Building a central eLearning portal for the Republic of Croatia Special educational programs will be offered to target groups such as minorities young people adults with low educational achievement persons with special educational needs and those who live in villages or remote areas and in areas of special state concern A system of external evaluation with standardized procedures will be established to develop manage and improve the monitoring of the knowledge and skills acquired Evaluation will also cover the overall work of schools and teaching staffs http www mzos hr default asp jezik ru sid Higher education will be improved by measures that will decrease the number of students who give up their studies and increase the number of students completing their studies within the regular time frame Development of Teaching and Learning The processes of learning and teaching will aim to promote lifelong learning while respecting social and individual needs in order to facilitate employment Through appropriate and effective support pupils will be encouraged to remain in the education process A supportive atmosphere will be developed partner relationships encouraged and the educational content will be linked with practical applications Knowledge skills and abilities gained in the course of informal learning will also be recognized The Croatian National Education Standards will be established and drawn up for primary and secondary education New forms of teaching and learning will be developed in the classroom and outside of school This process will be achieved by improving the initial training of teachers extending probation periods for young teachers providing intensive continuous professional in service training for teachers and professional training for principals and staff associates A system will be introduced for the long term support of professional training for teachers and principals to help them improve the quality of teaching and management in schools The vulnerable groups of pupils who make up about to percent of the Croatian education system are particular challenges to improving teaching The goal is to develop flexible school and extra curricular programs for all pupils thus preventing educational and social exclusion With the aim of early intervention and prevention measures will be taken to improve the teaching of children and young people with special educational needs and to develop various forms of counseling for pupils and their families at all stages of education Support will be given for information technology education in educational institutions and for initial and long term professional training for teaching staff In order to prevent social divisions and the exclusion of individuals and groups measures will be taken to enable unified access to educational services in the entire Republic of Croatia Developing Links Between Education and the Labor Market Scientific and technological development social changes and employment changes are the key reference points for the development of education Learning while working becomes an exceptionally important form of professional training and innovations are frequently inter disciplinary as the result of team work In the education system therefore it is necessary to establish regional inter disciplinary networks which will provide the necessary cooperation between the education system researchers and the labor market Linking education with the labor market is a key factor in forming a Croatian education system which will be able to respond to market and social changes thereby increasing opportunities for employment For this reason it is necessary to develop a unified system of school based and professional guidance that is recognized in the EU countries as the tool of a unified policy of education and employment In the conception development and application of education policies at all levels all interested social and economic partners are invited to be involved Education in entrepreneurship will be introduced as a developmental element within the existing educational framework of preschool and primary schools right up to higher education and adult education Targeted professional training and support for teaching staff will be provided Developing Educational Opportunities for Adults One of the main aims of the education system is to increase the opportunities for including adults in the education system It is the responsibility of the education system to enable the adult population to develop the knowledge and skills necessary for daily life Adult education has an important role in meeting the needs of the labor market The emphasis will be on training adults who have less schooling in literacy and math and vocational skills which will contribute to their employability Those who implement nationwide adult education will contribute to the development of an education system with defined levels of achievement aligned with those in the European Union Europassis a group of templates created by the European Commission transforming national qualifications into a joint format and international language http europass cedefop eu int htm index htm Improving Educational Opportunities and Equal Access a Equal Access to Education Everyone must have an equal right to education and training according to their own abilities needs and individual development regardless of their monetary situation The realization of equal access to education is one of the key elements in successfully preventing social exclusion In order to provide equal conditions for horizontal and vertical mobility all young people must be given equal chances The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia guarantees obligatory and free primary education to all under equal conditions Article State bodies and the local community will work together to make equal access possible for all to pre school education and obligatory education throughout the country Special emphasis will be placed on improving the situation in the less developed areas villages islands hilly and mountain areas demographically endangered areas and those affected by the war In line with the Constitutional Law on Rights of National Minorities and the Law on Education in National Minority Languages and Scripts education will be provided suitable to the needs of national minorities The education of the Roma will be carried out in line with the National Program for the Roma and the Action Plan adopted by the Government of the Republic of Croatia Social and private initiatives will be encouraged for opening children s kindergartens with a variety of programs for preschool education so that every child may be included b Participation in Education A problem which will receive particular attention in Croatia relates to the early departure of students from the education system In other words a relatively large number of young people do not enroll at secondary school or do not complete the coursework This group is socially vulnerable since it is exposed to poverty and social exclusion and could possibly resort to socially unacceptable behavior According to the latest figures percent of primary school graduates continue secondary education in the same year The following measures will be taken to provide education and training for those who do not complete primary and secondary schooling The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia http www usud hr htdocs en the constitution htm Official Gazette No Official Gazette No http www vlada hr Download NACIONALNI PROGRAM ZA ROME ENGLESKI TEKST pdf Action Plan of the Decade for Integration of Roma Government of the Republic of Croatia Zagreb March Long term and varying forms of student guidance and counseling will be carried out Flexible secondary education will be promoted by bridging programs to allow students to switch between vocational and general programs and vice versa Monitoring and individual guidance and counseling for those who have not gained entry into post compulsory education or training will be developed in cooperation with social and other partners New forms of lifelong learning will be introduced and adults will receive training for skills and jobs that are in short supply After the completion of secondary education progress will be monitored as students progress to higher levels of education and join the labor market State and local governments will promote access to preschool education to increase the number of preschool children in the last year before entering primary schooling c Student Enrollment in Tertiary Education Institutions Despite the increase in the number of higher education institutions and programs a large number of young people due to their financial status do not enroll in the field of study that corresponds to their expectations and capabilities This trend reduces access to equal educational opportunities for all Measures to promote equal educational opportunities for all during enrollment in tertiary education will be developed Together with economic and other partners scholarship modules for enrolled students with insufficient financial means will be developed Introduction of the national Matura examination will facilitate the access of candidate students to tertiary education d Regional Equality In Croatia there are large regional disparities in the application rates to secondary and higher education The Ministry of Science Education and Sports in cooperation with the ministries responsible for the economy employment and regional development as well as social partners and local authorities will help develop regional human resource development plans in line with regional economic and social development needs and the needs of the local population Measures will be taken to ensure equal access to education in the different parts of the country Supporting the Continuing Professional Development of Teachers and Other Education Personnel Currently in Croatia there are several categories of teachers who were educated at different types of institutions A mid and long term goal for the Croatian teaching workforce is to create an all graduate profession in order to equalize the professionalism and status of teaching staff at all levels of the education system Teaching is a highly skilled and demanding profession and teacher education is central to educational quality Therefore it is necessary to provide teachers with a theoretical understanding of complex goals and tasks and provide practical training on how to perform them effectively Croatia s social transformation and accession to EU membership require the application of lifelong learning and continuing professional development CPD in an effort to respond to the new demands placed on teaching staff Enhanced learning and teaching on all levels is stressed as the ultimate goal of educational policy in educational institutions The means of achieving this goal require an enhanced teacher education system that will enable them to understand not only educational aims but also the needs of the pupils and their families as they operate in a changing social cultural economic and technological environment There is also an urgent need to develop and finance a comprehensive national strategy for teacher education developed in consultation with key stakeholders and others who are responsible for the implementation of education This strategy refers to the complete process of teacher education through the three phases of initial education internship and continuing training The strategy includes a mixed model of financing government local private and foreign investment In the initial teacher education program the Bologna Process will provide the framework and impetus for modernizing the teacher education curriculum and its harmonization with the EU standards Priorities for initial education as well as in service training will be to acquire quality subject knowledge student centered teaching methods familiarity with the use of information and communication technologies ICT and an awareness of national identity inter cultural understanding and competency in foreign languages An integrated model of professional learning should aim to train teaching staff to apply the content of their teaching to real life experience a Initial Teacher Education Changes in the school system require the continuous improvement of teacher education programs and the development of education institutions implementing such programs The pre service teacher education system will be modernized in order to better understand the scientific basis of the subject he she specializes in Modernization will also focus on the adoption of pedagogical skills necessary for efficient practices in an education system that needs to respond to the needs of a contemporary society The requirements of the Bologna process for teacher education will be implemented b The Continuing Professional Development and Training of Teachers The Government is responsible for the professional pedagogic and psychological training of teachers and their pre service teacher training Similarly the Government also finances supplementary training in areas defined as having major relevance to education policy Other continuing professional development is the employers responsibility The costs incurred from teachers continuing professional training are co financed by the Government as part of the statutory state aid for education Regarding the continuing professional development of instructors teaching vocational subjects in vocational and other schools the changes in the nature and content of teaching necessitate a special Development Plan The educational policy priorities for the continuing professional training of school principals and teaching staff at educational institutions professional learning communities include gaining the knowledge and skills to establish networks of contacts and partner relationships with parents and the local community The priorities are The design and management of innovative projects Curriculum development and the use of contemporary teaching methods The use of information and communication technology in teaching The promotion of entrepreneurial skills On the job learning The development of cooperation and sharing of best practices between schools and the acquisition of the knowledge and Skills necessary to work with children with special educational needs A national strategy for implementing the new curriculum will be prepared to help the professional development of preschool primary and secondary school teachers trainers and instructors in vocational education and training as well as teachers and trainers in adult education and training who will implement the new curriculum A continuing professional training for teachers will be introduced specifying rights and responsibilities regarding annual training and development A renewable teaching license will be introduced Educational bodies and county based subject councils composed of subject specific teachers in each county will play an important role in improving subject specific teaching quality as well as improving the entire education system Guide to the Croatian National Education Standards for Primary Schools CNES Ministry of Science Education and Sports c Development of Education Institution Management The overall aim of the Development Plan is to develop schools as professional learning communities The improvement of the education system assumes that schools will become learning communities in which the pupils may gain knowledge and life skills and teachers can learn in a partnership relationship with the pupils In this environment the head teacher principal has a key role in supporting and carrying out the proposed changes To perform these tasks successfully head teachers principals must understand the goals of the new school and possess knowledge of the curriculum contemporary teaching methods and forms of learning They need to be agents of change leaders providers of resources and material improvement innovators and they need to develop good communication skills The management of educational establishments will be improved by increasing the management skills of principals Launching a licensing project for school principals head teachers is envisioned d Education Management and Financing The non existence of the institutional education of principals and the insufficient management and leadership capacities at educational institutions point to the need to draft a program for training principals Training principals to foster more intense cooperation between schools and local communities and parents is also important Develop and implement the national strategy and school management system by Define national policy for the evaluation of educational outcomes by Implement a pilot project for a self evaluation system for schools by the end of Begin its roll out in early By ensure that percent of pre school principals percent of primary school principals and percent of secondary school principals have completed the minimum required management training The performance of the internal management and the monitoring of the central regional and local institutions will determine the pace and extent of the planned changes The management and fiduciary capacities of the central administration as well as the regional education offices will be strengthened The decentralization of education management will be advanced to fall in line with regional needs and educational sector development strategy Development of Management Strategies for an Efficient Educational System Strengthening the Management System A successful education system requires good administration and effective financing along with other management mechanisms An appropriate division of labor between decision makers and effective managers makes the implementation of educational policies possible Amendments to legislation the devolution of power and the reform of the finance systems have increased the need for changes in educational administration especially with regard to evaluation and monitoring performance Educational management at national regional and local levels as well as education at the institutional level will be developed in a coordinated manner to enable the short and medium term implementation of development measures and to support and promote the achievement of education policy targets in the long term Target and results oriented management will be developed throughout the entire educational system Regional cooperation among educational institutions will be strengthened by exchanges of program and organizational experience with the aim of improving the quality of the education system University management will be developed to strengthen university autonomy accountability and internal management Increasing the Financing of Education A quality education system entails a sufficient level of public financing that ensures access to education services and stimulates competitiveness All of the new educational goals and challenges emphasize the importance of prioritizing education as an important element of future growth Special attention should be dedicated to possible public private partnerships The goals are Ensure that the state budget allocation for education as a percentage of GDP moves closer to European standards An adequate allocation of budget funds should be reserved to finance improvements in the education system Special attention will be given to financing education in poorer regions and minority education especially for those who are insufficiently integrated into society such as the Roma population Within budget limits state support should be extended to ensure support for adults who wish to complete their primary or secondary education and especially to those who need new qualifications and training for the labor market Student financial support will be developed to give incentives for continuing education As the Government cannot solely bear the financial burden new financing mechanisms and incentives will be supported for adult learning that encourage co investment by individuals and employers Direct Government subsidies will be earmarked primarily for those most in need Measures for Improving the Monitoring of Education Information management is critical for the effective and timely management of the education system Present day ministries have a key role in continuously following up on the implementation of education policies a process which requires sophisticated systems and professional capacities It is necessary to develop educational supervision professional and pedagogic management and inspection to guarantee respect for education legislation and standards The existing supervision needs to be gradually guided toward evaluation internal and external of educational establishments and the system as a whole The Education Management Information System EMIS will be established by The policy development and education sector monitoring by the Ministry of Science Education and Sportswill be strengthened The gathering of education related statistics will be improved throughout the education system Education system indicators will be developed to monitor the performance of the education system as well as all school activities It is necessary to establish a unified methodology for gathering data for the needs of the labor market and the educational system at all levels This methodology will provide the foundation for the development of a contemporary school system and professional information guidance and counseling Education for Social Cohesion and Economic Growth and Development Education is a strategic development priority for the development of Croatian society Considering that the quantity of new knowledge is expanding very fast knowledge acquired through the traditional education system becomes outdated and insufficient to meet the needs of an individual and the community Citizens must therefore be prepared for life in a knowledge based society and so it is necessary to develop an awareness of lifelong learning and provide everyone with the opportunity for education Lifelong learning is achieved through formal informal and natural learning http portal unesco org education en ev phpURL ID URL DO DO TOPIC URL SECTION html A Strategy for Adult Learning The Government of the Republic of Croatia November p Lifelong learning the process of lifelong learning is aimed at personal development the acquisition of new knowledge and more efficient adjustment to the labor market and new life circumstances The entire education system must be prepared to provide educational services to meet the different needs of its potential pupils All these activities need to be prepared by the schools in conjunction with the local community and various social partners Traditionally education systems and schools must preserve and maintain a significant role in the development of the individual and community as well as the transfer of cultural and national values In addition to traditional skills such as native language communication skills and mathematical literacy the EU has defined five new basic skills that every young person and adult need to acquire today These are Information and communication competencies Technological skills Foreign language abilities Nature and science literacy Entrepreneurial and social skills One area that requires special attention relates to specific pedagogic strategies for children with special needs Such strategies should contribute to the process of integrating special needs children into society All schools parents and the local community in the broadest sense will have a major role in the process of integrating these children into society The principles of lifelong learning will be strengthened at all levels of education by focusing on developing learning to learn attitudes and skills Social dimensions of education will be emphasized at all levels and in all fields of the education system Due to the increasing pace of social and economic change it is necessary to improve the flexibility of the education system so that individuals have greater opportunities to change their education training in line with the changing needs of the labor market and the concept of lifelong learning It is also necessary to develop a unified system of school based and professional guidance which will give individuals the opportunity to use information services guidance and counseling at all phases of their career development http europa eu int comm education policies doc basic skills en pdf Developing a System for the External Evaluation of Education An external evaluation system of educational processes and outcomes will be developed to ensure the proper implementation of educational legislation to support educational development and to improve the quality of learning The aim is to gather and analyze information in support of national education decision making and the local development of education and training The data compiled will be available to pupils and students their parents educational institutions state bodies businesses as well as other stakeholders interested in improving the system The Croatian education system lacks external student learning assessments or examinations The evaluation of a student s performance and achievements has been exclusively the responsibility of the school However more reliable transparent and comparable assessment data is needed especially at the end of secondary education With this aim the following steps will be taken A National Examination and Assessment Center will be operational in The National Matura Examination will be implemented for the academic year An international review of tertiary education will provide the opportunity to compare Croatian higher education with international standards Cooperation among different universities and other partners will be encouraged in the evaluation process With this aim the following step will be taken In a review of the tertiary education sector will be conducted within the framework of the OECD Tertiary Education Review project The results of this project will be published in The external assessment of student learning outcomes will also be applied to primary schooling With this aim the following step will be taken Croatia will participate in the PISA project in and The institution has been established pursuant to the Law on National Examination and Assessment Center Official Gazette No PISA Program for International Student Assessment international comparative tests organized and implemented by OECD in three year cycles TARGETS FOR CROATIAN EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT This chapter refers to qualitative and quantitative performance targets for the education system These targets are defined according to the expected development benchmarks in the European Union for A systematic summary of qualitative performance indicators can be found in the Annex Pre school and Primary Education The task of pre school and primary education is to develop children s competencies knowledge and skills that will help them grow up and act as creative competent humanistic oriented responsible and active members of modern society To fulfill this mandate the education sector must improve access to quality educational services modernize educational content and methods and support a plurality of options to develop the quality of learning and prevent exclusion The sector must also improve physical conditions such as learning facilities and equipment while strengthening the management system Special attention will be given to involving parents and the local community in forming partnerships with schools Pre school Education Local communities are most frequently the founders of daycare centers and they finance pre school activities in their area Such communities also have the greatest responsibility to organize pre school education Pre school education for children from the age of months to years forms the core of early childhood education This helps to reduce differences in social background and learning abilities and meets the child s developmental needs as closely as possible while preparing children for their entry into the world of conscious learning entry into primary school Facilities staff and equipment resources are recommended in order to include all children in preschool education programs and particularly in preparation programs for school preschool Pre school institutions have trained staff that can provide high quality education to all pre schoolers and especially to those with special needs and gifted children Special attention will be given to pre schoolers from socially and economically disadvantaged families by including them in pre school institutions See Table pp Development objectives By increase enrollment rates in preschool programs from the current rate of to By increase the participation of children in preschool one year before starting primary school from the current rate of to Primary Education The developmental priority for primary education is to raise the quality and efficiency of pupils schooling and to develop the necessary knowledge and skills that will enable a pupil s personal development A priority is also to help students finish primary education with the aim to continue education regardless of capabilities gender and religious national or regional affiliation or social status Development objectives By increase the net enrollment ratio of pupils from the current rate of to and the completion rate from the present rate of to By increase the number of primary schools working in a single shift from the current rate of to and by abolish classes operating in triple shifts a Developing the Croatian National Education Standards and National Curriculum guidelines for primary school Development of the National Curriculum guidelines will enable the harmonization of the national curriculum guidelines with European standards The Croatian National Education Standards CNES for primary schools will be finalized in The National Curriculum guidelines Council will be established in The preparation of the National Curriculum guidelines for primary school based on the CNES is planned by

of Croatia The experiences of these schools will be monitored and evaluated During the academic year all primary schools will start implementing the CNES and the National Curriculum By the end of teachers will have completed a training program for the implementation of the CNES and the new curriculum guidelines By all teachers will have acquired the basic level of ICT competencies b Evaluating Primary Education Outcomes Improving the quality of education also implies the introduction of education process and outcome evaluation about which students teachers parents and education management would be informed The creation of new evaluation methods that will guide the development of teaching and management in schools is especially important The PISA project will make it possible to evaluate obligatory education at an international level In and within the framework of the OECD PISA project pupils aged were assessed on how they had developed the ability to analyze draw conclusions and successfully communicate as well as gaining sustainable learning skills Croatia did not participate in that program either in or in so unlike the other countries that took part in the PISA project Croatia does not have reference data to use in comparing the performance of Croatian pupils to their international peers in It should be mentioned that due to the non compliance of the testing model with current teaching methods in Croatian schools the interpretation of the results should be viewed with caution as in other Central European countries Current internal or school evaluation is subjective mostly due to the lack of national standards for learning evaluation Therefore it is important to develop a new national system for internal and external evaluation and simultaneously start with teacher training External evaluation on the basis of experimental external evaluation of educational achievement in each class and for each subject will be prepared and implemented by the National Examination and Assessment Center or another licensed institution in cooperation with the Ministry of Science Education and Sports Recommendations on what makes a good school in Croatia will be developed with the help of teachers students parents and principals http www pisa oecd org pages en html The performance of schools will be monitored and incentives will be planned for schools that

Republic of Croatia includes special needs children in its education system The Act on Pre School Education regulates the priority of enrollment of special needs children in kindergartens Special needs children have the same mandatory and free primary education as all other children do These special needs children do have priority in enrolling in secondary schools However due to insufficient financial resources and the organizational inadequacy of schools numerous pupils with physical disabilities are not completely included in the regular education system To achieve better integration of pupils with special needs teaching staffs need to be better trained to work with these pupils For that purpose the existing teaching personnel shall be trained through professional teacher training processes New contemporary curricula will be developed for the education and training of special needs pupils A monitoring system for special needs children even after they complete their schooling will be organized Special institutions managed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfareto provide professional logistic support to the regular educational system will be regulated Official Gazette

titles and degrees with the law and the international classification of occupations Involve the largest possible number of teaching staff in annual training programs Financing Higher Education In the course of the next planning period it is necessary to establish a new system of financing higher education This system will replace the existing inherited system of direct state administration of financial support for a part of the university system Financial support by the direct allocation of funds to faculties will be replaced by allocations of lump sums to university management starting on January This change will give universities the chance to carry out their development strategies in accordance with national priorities strategies and the principle of polycentric development Efforts will be made to increase total state budget provisions for higher education based on affordability A major effort will be made to increase financing from other sources particularly the private sector This particularly applies to programs that can ostensibly meet the needs of staff while receiving funding from sources other than the state budget Croatian higher education institutions will be encouraged to compete for financial support intended for scientific research projects and study programs provided by national and international European bodies During the to period a model for student scholarships needs to be developed appropriate to the needs of students and society This scholarship program will target specific occupations and human resources throughout the Republic of Croatia
