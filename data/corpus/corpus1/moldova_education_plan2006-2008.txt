The resource envelope for the consolidated action plan for the education sector is provided by the Medium Term Expenditure Framework MTEF for As Table shows this assumes that growth will be slightly slower than in recent years but still fast and that total government expenditure defined in the MTEF to include extra budgetary as well as consolidated budget expenditure externally as well as internally financed will maintain its share of GDP as will education expenditure This yields an increase in the total education budget between and of per cent in nominal and per cent in real terms Table MTEF projections of macro economic indicators and education budget Nominal GDP mn lei Average annual inflation Real GDP growth Total govt exp as of GDP Education exp as of GDP Education exp as of pub exp Total education budget mn lei As Table shows per cent of the expenditure under the plan of million lei is already included in the MTEF covered by either internal or committed external revenue Activities for which funding is sought are estimated to cost million lei In the case of early education and development these unfunded expenditures amount to per cent of total plan expenditures in the case of basic education only per cent Table Estimated costs of the Consolidated Action Plan and MTEF provisions Included Included in MTEF Not in MTEF in Plan mln lei per cent mln lei per cent Early education and development Children s access to quality basic education Education and development of children in difficulties Non formal education Education system computerization Secondary professional and specialized education Higher and post graduate education Total Three scenarios are developed in this Plan the current resource middle and high scenarios The current resource scenario assumes that no resources are available beyond what is already available in the MTEF The middle scenario assumes that only part of the extra funding per cent is available allowing only partial fulfillment of plan targets while the high scenario assumes that per cent of the extra funding is available allowing plan targets to be fully achieved Table shows the current resource scenario for the consolidated action plan with a per cent increase in nominal expenditures on these sub sectors between and per cent on early education and development and per cent on basic education Given inflation of per cent over this period Table above these are quite small increases in real terms Table Current resource scenario for consolidated action plan for the education sector Total Early education and development Children s access to quality basic education Education and development of children in difficulties Non formal education Education system computerization Secondary professional and specialized education Higher and post graduate education Total In two sub sectors early education and development and basic education the plan s targets include increases in enrolment rates Tables and show that only modest increases in rates are likely to be possible under the current resource scenario In both cases the distribution of expenditure between categories is assumed to retain the pattern prevailing in The number of institutions is assumed to remain unchanged The number of students is determined by the number in the relevant age group from demographic projections and the gross enrolment rate The number of teachers and non teachers is then determined by the student staff ratios which are assumed to remain unchanged Table shows that in the case of early education and development an increase in enrolment rate from around per cent in to around per cent in would be feasible It would be consistent with nominal increases in average personnel expenditure per teacher of per cent and non personnel expenditure per student of per cent over the period ahead of the rate of price inflation Table Current resource scenario for early education and development Total

Table High scenario for consolidated action plan for the education sector Total million lei Early education and development MTEF Children s access to quality basic education Education and development
