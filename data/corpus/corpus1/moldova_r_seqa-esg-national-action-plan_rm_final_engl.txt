the Government with distinct responsibilities in the field of quality assurance in education In as a result of the absorption of the National School Inspectorate and the National Council for Attestation and Accreditation by the National Agency for Quality Assurance in Professional Education the National Agency for Quality Assurance in Education and Research ANACEC was established which is the successor of the rights and obligations of the absorbed legal entities As a result of that reform the Statute of the Agency has changed Thus from an organizational point of view in accordance with the provisions of the Education Code of the Republic of Moldova no and of the Regulation on the organization and operation of the National Agency for Quality Assurance in Education and Research no of

framework From an operational point of view ANACEC implements state policies in the field of quality assurance in education at all levels general education vocational education and training higher education and continuing education as well as in research and innovation The attributions of ANACEC regarding the quality assurance in higher education provide for elaboration of the methodology and external evaluation criteria in order to authorize the provisional operation and accreditation of study programs and higher education institutions and their submission to the MECR to be promoted for

the provisions of the normative framework in the field of activity of the Agency The external evaluation is performed by ANACEC in accordance with the Methodology of external quality evaluation for the authorization of the provisional operation and accreditation of VET higher education and continuing education study programs and institutions approved by Government Decision no of with the subsequent completions and modifications and with the Guidelines for external evaluation of the study programs on university cycles and of the higher education institutions approved by the Governing Board of ANACIP minutes no from During the Guidelines for external evaluation of bachelor s degree programs cycle I and integrated higher education and the Guidelines for external evaluation of master s degree programs National action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the Republic of Moldova for the period cycle II were revised and updated taking into account educational standards at national and European level the results and findings made following the first cycle of external evaluations carried out in the period good national and international practices in the field In order to ensure the quality of the documents developed the opinions of the evaluated higher education institutions the ANACEC Profile Committee in Higher Education the Ministry of Education Culture and Research the Agency s evaluators and other stakeholders were consulted For example in the process of updating the Guidelines for external evaluation of master s degree programs cycle II webinars were organized in which about beneficiaries of the process were actively involved and formulated proposals to improve the evaluation standards representatives of higher education institutions teachers program managers institutional managers in the field of Quality Management Systems and expert evaluators of ANACEC After consulting the opinion of all interested actors the updated guidelines were approved by the Governing Board Decision no of In accordance with the updates made in the mentioned documents the working tools of the external evaluation panel were also revised the Site visit record sheet and the External evaluation report for bachelor s degree integrated higher education study programs master s degree study programs During ANACEC also started the process of updating the Guidelines for the external evaluation of doctoral degree study programs Subsequently the activity on this document was partially stopped considering the provisions of the Higher Education project financed by the World Bank which will contribute decisively to the elaboration updating of the normative framework for doctoral studies At the same time although existing but never applied the Guidelines for the external evaluation of higher education institutions also needs to be revised on the basis of the best practices of European quality assurance agencies and the own experience gained during the evaluation of study programs In carrying out the external evaluation activities ANACEC involves expert evaluators that the Agency selects based on its own Methodology for selecting the expert evaluators The selection of the expert evaluators is made through an open competition announced by ANACEC on its website The examination and acceptance of the file the evaluation and selection of the expert evaluators is done by the Department of Evaluation in Higher Education and the profile committee in higher education The selected candidates are included in the Register of ANACEC s expert evaluators on general fields of study External evaluation panels must include expert evaluators representing academia students and the business environment employers At the same time the composition of the external evaluation panels includes as the case may be international experts from the partner quality assurance agencies Independence of ANACEC in terms of formal outcomes following the result of the external quality assessment the members of the external evaluation panels based on the findings and analyzes formulate by mutual agreement a series of strengths recommendations mandatory areas for improvement proposals for decisions on the evaluated study program which they subsequently present at the meetings of the profile committee for examination and validation The decision of the external evaluation panel validated by the profile committee is submitted for approval to the ANACEC Governing Board The final decision on the authorization for provisional operation accreditation non accreditation or withdrawal of the right of activity of a higher education institution or organization of a study program is adopted by the Ministry of Education Culture and Research based on the results of the evaluation performed by the Agency National action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the Republic of Moldova for the period Therefore the operation of the National Agency for Quality Assurance in Education and Research the attributions of the president vice president secretary general and of the profile committees conditions procedures for their selection and appointment structure and staff of the administrative apparatus methodology of calculation of fees as well as fees charged for evaluation procedures remuneration of members of the Governing Board profile committees administrative apparatus and expert evaluators are established by regulatory acts approved by the Government in coordination with the Ministry of Education Culture and Research The strict regulation of the staff including the positions and functions conditioned by the statute of ANACEC as a subordinate structure of the MECR caps the salaries for employees and practically makes impossible the interventions of adapting the staff to the current needs of the Agency For example the position of lawyer is missing even if the accomplishment of the entity s attributions requires even two specialists in law On the other hand this situation regarding the strictly regulated remuneration of civil servants negatively influences the level of attractiveness of the positions put up for competition Another challenge refers to the staff of the Department of Evaluation in Higher Education The conceptualization activities updating of the normative and methodological framework the organization of the process of external evaluation of study programs and higher education institutions elaboration of thematic studies as well as other activities in the field of competence are carried out within the Department of Evaluation in Higher Education by employees head of department main specialist senior specialist specialist The number of employees of the Department according to the regulated staff number of the administrative apparatus of the Agency is of maximum persons However even in the case of completing the staff number of the Department with people this low number of employees and the amount of their workload is not sufficiently related to the number of study programs and higher education institutions subject to external evaluation Thus in order to solve to some extent this deficiency it is necessary to review and adapt the normative regulatory framework in this regard QA activities and their methodologies Quality assurance in higher education is achieved through a set of actions to develop the institutional capacity to develop plan and implement study programs which forms and strengthens the trust of beneficiaries that the institution providing education meets and improves quality standards in accordance with its mission The fully functional national quality assurance system involves two successive stages a the authorization for provisional operation which represents the act of establishing the institution and grants the right to carry out the educational process and to organize the admission to studies b accreditation which grants in addition to the rights provided above the right to organize the final exam as well as the right to issue diplomas certificates and other study documents recognized by the Ministry of Education Culture and Research Quality evaluation in higher education consists in the multi criteria examination of the extent to which an educational institution and its study programs meet national reference standards National action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the Republic of Moldova for the period Quality evaluation in higher education is a complex set of self evaluation internal evaluation and external quality evaluation activities in accordance with approved accreditation standards criteria and indicators Self evaluation of quality in higher education is carried out by the institutional structures responsible for quality assurance in accordance with the national standards in force External quality evaluation in higher education is carried out by the National Agency for Quality Assurance in Education and Research or another quality assurance agency registered in the European Quality Assurance Register in Higher Education EQAR Quality evaluation in higher education aims at a institutional capacity b educational efficiency including academic results c the quality of the initial and continuous professional training programs d institutional quality management e the results of scientific research and or artistic creation f the concordance between the internal evaluation and the real situation Both self evaluation and external evaluation are carried out in accordance with the procedure described in the Methodology for external quality evaluation for the authorization of the provisional operation and accreditation of vocational education and training higher education and continuing education study programs and institutions with the Guidelines for the external evaluation of bachelor s degree programs cycle I and integrated higher education master s degree programs cycle II doctoral study programs and the Guidelines for the external evaluation of higher education institutions Thus the external quality evaluation procedure is initiated at the request of the higher education institution consortium partnership subsidiary founder Ministry of Education Culture and Research together with the submission of the application and the evaluation dossier to the specialized department within the Agency Following the approval of the dossier which also includes the self evaluation report the Agency s specialized department proposes for approval in the Governing Board the composition of the external evaluation panel and the evaluation coordinator within the department The members of the external evaluation panel analyze the dossier and the self evaluation report performs the evaluation site visit to the educational institution institutions and completes the Site visit record sheet with the findings made during the visit the completed Site visit record sheet is analyzed and countersigned by the educational institution prepares the external evaluation report which is sent to the educational institution to analyse it and formulate comments if any The results of the evaluation will be presented to the profile committee for validation and to the meeting of the Agency s Governing Board for decision making According to the Methodology for external quality evaluation applied by ANACEC the post evaluation monitoring follow up is performed in the external evaluation process for re accreditation when the external evaluation panel examines what concrete actions the educational institution has taken to achieve the mandatory improvement areas and recommendations formulated at the previous external evaluation accreditation standard performance indicator Implementing observations recommendations and decisions formulated based on the National action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the Republic of Moldova for the period external evaluation by the National Agency for Quality Assurance in Education and Research other quality assurance agencies If the study program or institution subject to external evaluation does not fully meet the requirements of the accreditation standards ANACEC requests the educational institution to undertake and implement improvement measures in accordance with the Post evaluation monitoring procedure of study programs and vocational education and training higher education and continuous training institutions approved at the meeting of the Governing Board of ANACEC on March The post evaluation monitoring procedure is mainly applied in case of impossibility to make the accreditation decision The external evaluation procedures and the decision of the Governing Board of the Agency regarding the authorization non authorization for provisional operation accreditation non accreditation of the study program educational institution may be challenged if they do not correspond to the Methodology for external evaluation in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation on the settlement of petitions submitted to the National Agency for Quality Assurance in Education and Research approved by the Board of ANACEC Decision no of March At the end of the appeal periods the decisions of the Governing Board are submitted to the Ministry of Education Culture and Research The final decision regarding the authorization for provisional operation non authorization accreditation non accreditation of the study program or of the educational institution is approved by the Ministry based on the decision of the ANACEC Governing Board The application of the Methodology for external quality evaluation for the authorization of the provisional operation and accreditation of vocational education and training higher education and continuing education study programs and institutions GD no is a permanent challenge for the Agency given the changes made without the prior consultation and agreement of ANACEC in the text of the Methodology by GD no of December and in particular point concerning decisions made based on the results of external evaluation by excluding two types of decisions without changing the adjacent score which generated a regulatory vacuum National agency criteria in external quality assurance The Methodology for external quality evaluation for the authorization of the provisional operation and accreditation of vocational education and training higher education and continuing education study programs and institutions was elaborated by ANACEC in accordance with the national and European normative framework international recommendations in the field in particular

European reference framework for quality assurance in education and training C The European Quality Assurance Framework in Vocational Education and Training EQAVET Framework developed by the European Quality Assurance Network in Vocational Education and Training EQAVET The external evaluation of the quality for the authorization of the provisional operation and the accreditation of study programs and educational institutions is performed based on the accreditation standards criteria and performance indicators established in the annexes to the Methodology for the external evaluation as well as the evaluation standards and the mandatory minimum evaluation standards set out in the Guidelines for the external evaluation In Annex we present a table for connecting the accreditation standards criteria performance indicators and evaluation standards applied by ANACEC in the process of external evaluation of the quality of bachelor s degree programs cycle I and integrated higher education as an example to the recommendations formulated in the ESG guidelines The accreditation standards criteria and performance indicators as well as evaluation standards are developed in accordance with the recommendations of the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area ESG part I and national standards in the field of education promoted by various documents

into account their moral integrity The Methodology for the selection of expert evaluators describes in detail the procedure and requirements for entering the competition the selection process the management of the Agency s Register of Experts the rights and rules of conduct of experts The expert evaluators have the following rights to participate at the request of ANACEC in the evaluation of general education vocational education and training higher education and continuous training institutions and or study programs to act within the external evaluation missions based on their own values and according to the provisions of the legislation in force National action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the Republic of Moldova for the period to use in a professional manner with dignity and honor the academic expertise and professional competencies they have in order to objectively evaluate the institutions providing educational services and or study programs to participate at the request of ANACEC as a member in the panels groups of experts of evaluation and or to carry out the expertise of the dossiers and papers submitted to ANACEC to participate in professional training programs organized by ANACEC The work of expert evaluators must be governed by the fundamental principles and rules of conduct presented in Annex ANCEC verifies the observance of the provisions regarding the professional conduct and initiates corrective measures if necessary If the expert evaluator does not observe or neglect the rules of conduct they will be excluded from the Register without the right to re register If the committed deeds meet the constitutive elements of a crime ANACEC will notify in accordance with the law the competent bodies and institutions In general the members of the external evaluation panel which must include representatives of the academic environment specialists in the evaluated field representatives of students who are students at the time of the external evaluation process and representatives of employers who carry out their professional activity in the field subject to evaluation but also foreign experts must be independent not represent the interests of the organization to which they belong or of other third parties confirm the absence of conflicts of interest and have the obligation to keep confidentiality of information A challenge in the selection and involvement of expert evaluators however lies in the fact that the Republic of Moldova is a small country where the entire academic community forms a family and respectively everyone knows each other Thus in order to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest of any kind the Agency places great emphasis on involving experts for peer reviews and raising awareness of this fact The training of expert evaluators is a mandatory part of the external quality evaluation process for the authorization of the provisional operation and accreditation of study programs and higher education institutions It aims to develop and ensure the necessary competencies of external experts to promote the objectivity and consistency of the Agency s decisions in the field of external quality assurance in higher education The training of the expert evaluators is carried out through training sessions which are organized periodically by the Agency in accordance with the training methodology of the expert evaluators of ANACEC The calendar of training sessions for expert evaluators is established according to the needs of the Agency In particular the training of expert evaluators shall take place systematically before each external evaluation mission with regard to the provisions of the external evaluation methodology the rights and obligations of expert evaluators including ethical conduct the use of external evaluation tools Site visit record sheet External evaluation guidelines the elaboration of the external evaluation report As a result of the analysis of the opinion of the interested parties evaluators higher education institutions MECR the interest for solid training with a longer duration was found with the certification of trainees based on a final assessment In this regard the Department of Evaluation in National action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the Republic of Moldova for the period Higher Education has developed a training course for evaluators designed with a duration of hours ECTS credits The target group is represented by the following categories of trainees teachers with scientific scientific didactic and or managerial titles students and employers The course will allow trainees to participate in the competition for the selection of expert evaluators and their inclusion in the Register of expert evaluators by fields and to apply correctly the working tools in the external evaluation process Stakeholder engagement The categories of stakeholders actively involved in quality assurance activities in higher education are higher education institutions teachers students and business representatives the Council of Rectors the Ministry of Education Culture and Research Thus in the composition of the Governing Board of the Agency which is the collective management body that ensures the elaboration and implementation of the Agency s strategy there are representatives of teachers students and employers At the same time the external evaluation panels are constituted on principles of representativeness obligatorily including the following categories of stakeholders representatives of the academic environment representatives of the students and representatives of the employers businesses In the following table we present the stakeholders involved in the external quality assurance processes carried out by ANACEC their frequency and level of involvement Stakeholder categories Number of meetings Formal informal Level of involvement activities Teachers students

representatives responsible for quality assurance study program coordinators in order to complete the self evaluation dossiers explain the working tools used by ANACEC in the external evaluation process scheduled periods for submitting applications for external evaluation of study programs In order to motivate experts to participate in the external evaluation process the Agency encourages the activities of evaluators and evaluated institutions by awarding diplomas of recognition and the Quality Crystal distinction systematic involvement of evaluators in external evaluation missions expert training sessions dissemination on social media pages e g Facebook Agency website encouraging motivating recognizing their expertise in order to continuously improve the quality of education and the higher education system In order to identify potential evaluators in various fields of training and involve them in the Agency s external evaluation activities several information seminars and training sessions are organized which explain the evaluation procedure stages rights and responsibilities of expert evaluators etc In order to ensure the dissemination of good practices regarding the external evaluation process as well as to intensify the inter institutional collaboration ANACEC aimed to identify and involve experts from as many higher education institutions as possible At the same time in the conditions of applying the external evaluation procedure of the quality of some study programs which are provided by only one higher education institution State University of Medicine and Pharmacy Technical University of Moldova Agrarian State University of Moldova State University of Physical Education and Sports it was a real challenge to identify potential evaluators considering the fact that the market of educational services in the Republic of Moldova is very limited Also in the process of selecting the evaluators ANACEC pays special attention to students and employers representatives whose involvement contributes to increasing the connection between the contents offered in the national higher education system and labor market requirements to the development of the practical applicative nature of the study programs In this regard representatives of employers from several institutions were identified selected and trained such as State Chancellery Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ministry of Health Labor and Social Protection Research Institutes subordinated Ministry of Education Culture and Research state and private enterprises etc Analyzing the composition of the external evaluation panels from the perspective of the higher education institution where the evaluators work we can conclude that in the external evaluation process organized by ANACEC were trained as experts teachers with scientific degrees and students from universities and employers representatives from over profile institutions in the country including international experts from ARACIS The main objective of the Department of Evaluation in Higher Education in this segment of activity was to strengthen the database of expert evaluators diversify evaluators according to areas of training so that they can cover as many study programs motivation and promoting the involvement of students with an active role in the external evaluation process setting up ad hoc evaluation panels to avoid possible prior agreements or National action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the Republic of Moldova for the period litigation promoting professionalism objectivity and the spirit of collegiality in external quality evaluation activities Another important aspect is the feedback provided to the experts The members of the evaluation panels are given feedback in relation to their activity e g how they behaved during the site visit but also what topics were not discussed Institutions are required to provide feedback in the form of a post evaluation questionnaire on the work of experts However the experts are not informed about the feedback that ANACEC receives from institutions In the context of capitalizing on collaboration agreements with partner quality assurance agencies continuously updating the register of evaluators as well as in order to strengthen the composition of external evaluation panels ANACEC involves both external evaluators of ARACIS in the process of external evaluation of study programs as well as citizens of the Republic of Moldova abroad who work in higher education and or research institutions Thematic analysis In order to align with the requirements set out in the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area ESG the National Agency for Quality Assurance in Education and Research has initiated the process of developing thematic studies In this sense ANACEC following the external evaluations of the bachelor s degree programs in the general field of study Arts elaborated the thematic study The external evaluation of the quality of the bachelor s degree study programs in the general field of study Arts and Humanities The study is an analysis of the field of training Arts and humanities and contains a series of recommendations for various categories of beneficiaries At the same time in order to disseminate the results of the external evaluation to the evaluated study programs ANACEC plans the elaboration of thematic studies on general fields of study at the end of each evaluation cycle the publication of these studies on the Agency s website the presentation of study results within dissemination activities conferences seminars workshops round tables meetings National action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the Republic of Moldova for the period Priority actions In developing the Methodology for external evaluation the active and effective involvement of higher education institutions and other relevant stakeholders such as students potential employers ministries is an important way to increase their commitment to external quality assurance and quality assurance activities and to develop the level of trust between ANACEC and other stakeholders Their involvement is also very important from the perspective of raising awareness among all stakeholders about the expectations and perspectives that the Agency must take into account and accept in a balanced and reasonable manner However although all stakeholders need to be actively involved in the development of methodology regulations guidelines and other documents for the application of quality assurance procedures the Agency has the highest expertise in making the right decisions based on the various opinions presented At the same time it should be borne in mind that updates and changes should normally be made at the end of a cycle of activities e g external evaluation of bachelor s and master s degree study programs and that stakeholders should be involved in the continuous improvement of the methodology The accreditation standards in number implemented by ANACEC comply with the recommendations of the Standards and guidelines ESG part Standards and guidelines for internal quality assurance containing criteria performance indicators and evaluation standards that higher education institutions must perform in order to demonstrate the level of quality of the services provided At the same time ANACEC follows the requirements of ESG standards part Standards and guidelines for external quality assurance Thus higher education institutions conduct an internal evaluation and prepare the self evaluation report in accordance with the requirements set out in the Guidelines for external evaluation applied by ANACEC external evaluation panels are set up independently by the Agency the experts in these panels are trained on the whole external evaluation procedure the expert evaluators analyze the self evaluation reports of the institutions visit the institutions subject to evaluation interview the institution s management teaching staff students graduates employers analyze the relevant documentation complete the Site visit record sheet prepare the external evaluation report formulating strengths recommendations and mandatory areas of improvement to the evaluated study program the external evaluation report is sent to the institution for comments which are subsequently discussed in the panel and the corresponding decision is made the next step of analyzing the external evaluation report and approving the decision is made within the profile committee and only then the ANACEC Board takes the decision which is sent to the educational institution but also to the Ministry of Education Culture and Research for the final approval and decision making The Methodology for external evaluation modified in without the Agency s consent generates a series of ambiguities regarding the final results of the external evaluation In the current version the Methodology describes two types of decisions compared to four options in the initial version of the Methodology If all accreditation standards meet the requirements the Agency s Governing Board proposes to accredit the study program or educational institution for a period of years An National action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the Republic of Moldova for the period accreditation standard is considered to meet the requirements if more than of the performance indicators correspond to the mandatory minimum level set by the Agency If three or more accreditation standards do not meet the requirements or at least one mandatory minimum evaluation standard is not met the Agency s Governing Board proposes not to accredit the study program or educational institution An accreditation standard is considered non compliant if less than of the performance indicators meet the mandatory minimum level set by the Agency The current situation with a vacuum between and creates impediments because no decisions can be made if such situations are found The ANACEC Governing Board uses as an emergency solution included in the post evaluation follow up procedure the possibility to postpone the accreditation decision and to offer the institution the possibility to improve the situation and demonstrate the improvement initially presenting an Action Plan with corrective measures and subsequently a Report on the implementation of this plan on the basis of which the final decision is taken Although a second visit to the institution is legally allowed this is not done due to the lack of financial resources and the small number of Agency staff The emergency solution used by ANACEC undermines the consistency and reliability of the entire external quality evaluation process Thus the criteria for making final decisions need to be clarified The solution could be to return to the previous formula with four possible decision options or a compromise option could be to supplement it with a third conditional accreditation option In the case of accreditation decisions as a result of the external evaluation a post evaluation monitoring procedure follow up is not currently applied to all evaluated institutions study programs in the period until the next accreditation which means that the existing procedure is not consistent and complete in terms of achieving the full quality cycle but also compliance with ESG requirements Thus the concept the form of follow up may be different e g reports seminars conferences etc but it is also important that it includes the Agency s feedback In the external evaluation activities ANACEC involves expert evaluators included in the Register of expert evaluators of the Agency whose basic activity consists in carrying out a peer evaluation The evaluators who are part of the external evaluation panels always represent the academic environment students and employers business environment The experts are trained by ANACEC and their training is mandatory As perspective actions we aim to test professional competencies and certify expert evaluators continuously completing the Register of expert evaluators Considering the fact that in the Republic of Moldova there are study programs belonging to quite specific fields of professional training e g medicine horticulture agronomy sports veterinary medicine architecture etc these being provided only by a single higher education institution e g State University of Medicine and Pharmacy Technical University of Moldova State Agrarian University of Moldova etc it is a real challenge to identify potential expert evaluators given that the market for educational services in our country is very small In this sense but also in other cases the involvement of international experts is a solution and the regulatory framework allows this An impediment in achieving this goal is the fact that the entire external evaluation process is conducted in Romanian experts must know the legal framework and national context of higher education and the involvement of international experts involves higher costs from institutions However the co opting practices of foreign experts require development and expansion The mission of the Agency is established by the Government with tasks and attributions e g control that are not compatible with those of an independent quality assurance agency and oriented towards continuous quality assurance and improvement in education The independence of National action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the Republic of Moldova for the period the Agency is greatly affected by the changes made in in the Education Code the Methodology for External Evaluation and in the Regulation on the organization and operation of ANACEC Thus with regard to Organizational independence The ANACEC Governing Board is elected by a committee of independent experts appointed by the agencies registered in EQAR at the request of the Ministry of Education Culture and Research the president and vice president are elected and appointed by the Government and the Ministry of Education The agency does not define its structure and number of employees The Agency recruits its staff members according to the rules of the public competition and they carry out their activity within the limits provided by the Law on the civil service and the status of the civil servant The government defines the level of staff salaries hence the reluctance of specialists to work within the Agency Operational independence the selection recruitment of experts takes place without any influence from third parties the evaluation processes are carried out independently but in terms of defining its own procedures there is a limitation of the agency s independence even if the law says that ANACEC develops in accordance with European standards in the field and makes public its own methodology for the evaluation and accreditation of institutions providing professional training and their study programs which it proposes for approval to the Government e g modification in of the Methodology for external evaluation without consulting the Agency Independence of formal outcomes although the Governing Board makes the decision of authorization non authorization for provisional operation accreditation non accreditation the final decision is still adopted by the Ministry of Education Culture and Research The elaboration and continuous development of the normative and methodological framework in order to develop and consolidate a positive orientation of the academic community regarding the process of external quality assurance in higher education is a priority for ANACEC In view of the above several actions need to be taken Priority would be the changes of the existing regulatory framework in the field with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders MECR ANACEC higher education institutions business representatives students teaching staff etc to ensure the independence of ANACEC from third parties to exclude various interference in its activity and to increase its level of credibility and trust but also of the entire higher education system both at national and European international level Also in this order of ideas the active and effective involvement of stakeholders in ensuring the quality of studies must be strengthened and oriented towards creating a community and a culture of quality in our country At institutional level the Agency aims to establish such a stakeholder involvement procedure in order to strengthen its position and bring everyone to the same table of dialogue Last but not least the post evaluation monitoring procedure currently applied by ANACEC needs to be revised and supplemented in accordance with the ESG recommendations to ensure its consistency and relevance in order to continuously increase and improve the quality of studies offered by higher education institutions in the country with their active involvement National action plan on quality assurance of higher education in the Republic of Moldova for the period Summary table Note When reading this action plan it should be taken into account that many of the
