VISION TO PROVIDE THE BEST EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM IN EUROPEstrat new print final qxp Layout Page Executive Summary ACTION PLAN FOR EDUCATION Education is central to many of our ambitions as a nation whether they be n To break the cycles of disadvantage that can prevent some from fulfilling their full potential n To excel in fields of human endeavour n To create sustainable jobs with good prospects Excellent and innovative education and training are the pivot around which personal fulfilment a fair society and a successful nation should revolve It is central to sustaining economic success and in converting economic success into building a strong community The Programme for Government states that Education is the key to giving every child an equal opportunity in life No child should be left behind in economic recovery and we should use our strengthening economy to become a leader in the provision of world class education and skills Our Vision The central vision of our Statement of Strategy and Action Plan for Education is that the Irish Education and Training System should become the best in Europe over the next decade This is achievable as we are already a high performer in many fields but it is also a challenge towards which the many stakeholders in education and training can work together Education has been central to Ireland s transformation over recent decades It has played a very significant role in helping Ireland to successfully weather the exceptional economic crash It will be central to our ambitions as a nation economic cultural scientific and social over the coming years It will allow us to lead in innovation It will help us to achieve social inclusion Being the lead in Europe means an ambition to be the best at n Harnessing Education to break down barriers for groups at risk of exclusion n Delivering a learning experience to highest international standards n Equipping learners of all ages and capacities to participate and succeed in a changing world n Allowing Ireland to be a leader across a broad range of fields scientific cultural enterprise and public service This is a realistic ambition Ireland already has a top position in Europe in several important spheres for example post primary literacy third level participation take up of STEM at third level and a top position in others educational attainment innovation low dropout from school However there are other areas where there is significant ground to make up These include the achievement levels in science take up of gateway subjects and the availability of apprenticeships and traineeships in emerging areas of skills The key to achieving our ambition are the people who deliver day in day out adapting to the learning needs of those they help strat new print final qxp Layout Page Ireland is fortunate to attract high calibre people to the fields of teaching and training who deliver to high standards and who have established a strong international reputation However as new challenges place new demands on the education and training system we must ensure that we have the capacity to develop and adopt best practices Education institutions must themselves be learning organisations continually improving and evolving and learning from best practice Success in education is built on the quality of leadership the ingenuity in teaching the support in the community for learning and this Action Plan aims to harness those human resources To be the best we need to ensure that leadership management quality frameworks teaching methods and initial and continuing training are all operating to the highest standards We need to promote Innovation and Excellence recognise high achievement and seek to mainstream successful approaches The pursuit of this goal will always be constrained by the availability of financial resources However it is the clear articulation of the scope for Education and Training to impact on major national priorities which will help Education and Training prove the case for extra investment At the heart of the plan is the aim to improve the impact of the education and training experience on the lives of each and every learner and particularly those who are likely to face greater obstacles because of disadvantage or special needs Our Goals Education and training services support people throughout their lives They play a huge part in developing their mental resilience and personal wellbeing They equip people with the ability to adapt to work with others to think critically and to be creative They give people the skills and knowledge to fulfil their personal goals The education and training services set out in this Strategy and Action Plan are based on the core values that inspire those who work in education and training They recognise fundamental roles which the individual school or institution the leaders teachers and support sta have within them and seeks to strengthen practitioners capacity to deliver for learners They also seek to build strong two way bridges from Education and Training to the wider community to the benefit of each These principles are equally valid in every realm of Education and Training sector The Plan is summarised in five high level goals Improve the learning experience and the success of learners Improve the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage or learners with special educational needs Help those delivering education services to continuously improve Build stronger bridges between education and wider community Improve national planning and support services In each of these areas we aim to deliver systematic progress so we can realise our vision of being the best Education and Training service in Europe strat new print final qxp Layout Page ACTION PLAN FOR EDUCATION Objectives and Outcomes Reflecting on our high level goals we have identified key ambitions for the coming years which will represent important milestones of progress n Significantly reducing the gap with the top European performers in areas of numeracy and science n Significantly reducing the gap between low achieving students in literacy and numeracy in DEIS and those in non DEIS schools n Increasing the take up of gateway subjects Physics Chemistry Higher Level Mathematics and increasing opportunities for learning in the areas of coding and computer science n Enriching teaching and learning with new curricula new assessment methods and technology assisted learning n Promoting wellbeing in our school communities to support success in school and life n Continuing to improve retention rates at second level in DEIS schools from their current rate of to the national norm currently by n Increasing by points equivalent to the proportion of students at risk of disadvantaged who proceed to Higher Education n Systematically reducing the skills gap in areas of critical skill need in Higher Education by providing for upskilling and reskilling places n Increasing by a quarter the number of students undertaking a work placement or work project as part of their third level qualification by n Developing a strong stream of employer supported apprenticeships and traineeships providing places for young people in in career areas n Broadening the choice of schools available each year in line with the target of multi non denominational by n Contributing to the delivery of the cross departmental research targets in Innovation to enable Ireland become a Global Innovation Leader such as through an increase of funded postgraduate students an increase in the number of funded post doctoral researcher and the initiation of a new programme of funding for Frontier Research across all disciplines n Increasing upskilling and reskilling opportunities in education and training for those in work places in Higher Education including mature students as well as Further Education and Training and Skillnets places Some Key Actions Achieving these outcomes will require concerted action across all sectors of education and training in respect of each goal Amongst the actions are n Increasing the take up of Mental Health Programmes strengthening Guidance Counselling and strengthening NEPS with a new focus on whole school policies n Implementing the new Framework for Junior Cycle with its new short courses group projects and Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement strat new print final qxp Layout Page n Extending coding and ICT options in schools n Putting a new plan in place for DEIS schools to help achieve

centrally in terms of e ectiveness and e iciency and enhancing Service Level Agreements with all agencies of the Department strat new print final qxp Layout Page ACTION PLAN FOR EDUCATION The Action Plan Process The Action Plan is the start of a process It is not an exhaustive list of everything that will be done to deliver our ambitions in education over the next years Updated annual Action Plans will be published in December each year covering the actions that will be implemented during the subsequent months As part of this process n Actions will be monitored against published timelines n Each year a new Action Plan will be developed and published to further our goals in consultation with stakeholders n Responsibility for actions will be clearly assigned Furthermore the Department will publish progress reports each quarter that will evolve and improve from the experience of implementation strat new print final qxp Layout Page Foreword by the Minister The basic aim of this Government is to use our economic success to build a fair and compassionate society Few areas are more pivotal than education to our ambitions as a nation The quality of the service we provide through our education system will determine whether we can deliver our most important goals n To break cycles of disadvantage and ensure that every person has an opportunity to fulfil their potential n To create sustainable well paying jobs and strong economic growth n To solve the great problems through research and innovation and excel in culture art and every other field of human endeavour That is why I believe it is crucial that we set the highest ambitions for our education and training service because the quality of the service we deliver will directly determine whether we achieve these ambitions for our citizens In this strategy we are aiming to achieve the best education and training system in Europe over the next decade If we can do that this will mean that we are providing better opportunities for more people from disadvantaged groups By delivering the best training service in Europe we will ensure that we can create more of the sustainable well paying jobs that we so badly require We are lucky of course to already have a world class education system and no factor is more pivotal to that than the quality of the people who work in it and our actions must always be informed by that In this plan our high ambitions are matched by specific actions to deliver on them across all parts of the education service Actions are aimed at improving outcomes for the learners who depend on the service at breaking cycles of disadvantage at supporting teachers and institutions to continually improve at building better links between education and the broader community and at improving our systems on which we depend to deliver all this I want to thank all the people who contributed to creating this strategy including the individuals and groups who made submissions or held meetings with me my Oireachtas colleagues from across the House who contributed and to the people within my Department who did tireless work on putting the document together Too often in previous Governments ambitious plans like this were published but then little achieved Following the successful model pioneered in the Action Plan for Jobs we are putting mechanisms in place to ensure that delivery takes place Each of the hundreds of actions and sub actions are given clear timelines and lead responsibility for delivery is assigned We will publish quarterly reports showing how many of the actions stated for delivery in that quarter were achieved We will publish an annual action plan each year with more ambitious and more specific actions to be delivered In this way I believe we can work together with all the people who work in and depend on the education and training service to collectively make it into the best in Europe and deliver on the goals that we have set ourselves as a country Richard Bruton TD Minister for Education and Skills strat new print final qxp Layout Page ACTION PLAN FOR EDUCATION Statement by the Secretary General I am pleased to introduce the Department s Statement of Strategy and Action Plan which articulates our ambition values and goals that will serve as the basis for the Department s high level work programme for the next three years The Department is driving the implementation of an ambitious sector wide reform programme based on the key principles of access excellence transparency and innovation Our aim is to provide an education and training system that equips learners with the knowledge and skills that they need to achieve their potential and to participate fully in society and the economy through the delivery of high quality education and training experiences which will make the best use of resources It will work towards improving accountability for educational outcomes across the system It will take particular account of the needs and requirements of learners with disabilities or with special educational needs and learners impacted by disadvantage Our Action Plan sets out ambitious targets for each goal and it is our intention to meet these targets as resources permit This will require the support from all of the education partners The response to the public consultation process in the development of this Strategy and Action Plan underlined the impact that education and training has on so many lives Over interested parties took the time to share their vision and experience and I would like to thank everyone who took part in this While resources remain challenging I am confident that this interest will be sustained and that we will all work together over the next few years to deliver high quality services to achieve our ambition to provide the best education and training system in Europe Se n Foghl Secretary General strat new print final qxp Layout Page Our ambition To provide the best

complex environment shaped in particular by economic social technological cultural and demographic changes There is a general recognition amongst external stakeholders that the Department s main strengths are our strong values and commitment to education the high calibre of our management and sta and our dedication in dealing with a very challenging agenda The Department adopts a consultative approach with key partners in the education system in the development and implementation of its policies This is enshrined in much of the legislation dealing with educational matters and has helped to achieve a high level of shared understanding and commitment across the system as a whole While there remains scope for improvement the general consensus across diverse groups of stakeholders and observers both domestic and international is that the Irish education system is a good and cost e ective model Political Environment The new Partnership Government s ambition is to combine their di erent talents to build a strong economy and to deliver a fair society The priorities for education as articulated by the Government in the A Programme for a Partnership Government are to ensure that no child should be left behind in the economic recovery and we should use our strengthening economy to become a leader in the provision of world class education and skills and to improves people s lives Economic Environment The Irish economy is now firmly in recovery mode GDP is growing strongly exports are at historic highs employment is expanding and there has been considerable improvement in the public finances The short to medium term outlook is strong with estimated annual growth of around although risks to recovery remain Continued economic growth in the coming years will permit modest growth in public expenditure which will allow targeted improvements in public services including education and training Labour Market In collaboration with key stakeholders we will ensure that our education and training system provides flexible opportunities for learners to acquire the skills needed so that they can access the labour market and increase Ireland s competitiveness by addressing areas of strategic skills demands and deepening collaboration between industry and the education and training sector Increasing Demographic Pressures The Department has calculated a number of demographic scenarios and considers the figures below encompassing a medium migration assumption and an assumption of gradually declining fertility as the most likely scenario for the future A continuing increase in enrolments is expected at both first and second level At first level increases in births in recent years up to are reflected in the corresponding continuing increase in enrolments up to Enrolments will continue to rise to a peak of over in before beginning to reduce This peak figure is reflective of primary enrolment levels last seen in Ireland in the early s There will be a continuous decline thereafter to an anticipated level of in At second level there is also a year on year increase projected up to to a peak of followed by a continuous decline The second level projection follows directly from the trend seen at primary level in recent years of consistent year on year increases in enrolments as the increased numbers of pupils at primary level in recent years begin to transition to post primary education The numbers enrolled in higher education have been steadily increasing in recent years The chosen assumption suggests that demand for third level full time education is expected to continue to rise every year over the period reaching over by and by strat new print final qxp Layout Page Growing numbers of students at primary second and third level will present many challenges across the education and training system including the requirement for a significant programme of capital expenditure Managing Education and Training Sector Reform The Department is engaged in an extensive reform programme and continues to take a whole of system approach to strategic planning and implementation across the education and training sector This joined up approach enables us to plan and implement an extensive programme of reform and to balance this with the demands of supporting and sustaining the operation of our education and training system We will continue to work in partnership with key stakeholders to implement the significant changes that are planned across the continuum of education and training such as implementing shared services in the sector to allow providers to concentrate on the core functions of teaching and learning and increasing e iciencies Civil Service Renewal Plan We are fully committed to the ongoing programme of change in the Civil Service which seeks to build capacity to respond to existing and future challenges and improve the performance of the Civil Service and its sta The Civil Service Renewal Plan launched in provides the framework for renewing the Civil Service over a period of three years It outlines a vision for the Civil Service as well as practical changes to create a more unified professional responsive open and accountable Civil Service providing a world class service to the State It requires strong leadership and active participation Skills and Capacity The Department is engaged in on going development of the skills and capacities of DES sta in accordance with the Civil Service Renewal Plan and Strategic Workforce Planning objectives to ensure that we can deliver on our goals Over the term of the Strategy Statement the Department will engage with the Civil Service Learning Development Centre to access common learning and development interventions it has developed which are scheduled to be available from In addition the Department will continue to address training needs identified by sta in conjunction with line managers on PMDS forms to ensure that stated training needs are addressed and that sta are equipped with the essential skills to deliver their duties in an e ective manner The Department will also continue to encourage sta who wish to pursue third level qualifications that are relevant to their duties as a Civil Servant through the Advanced Payment of Fees and the Refunds of Fees schemes Ensuring equity As part of their public sector duty public bodies are required to consider human rights and equality issues relevant to them In preparing this document such issues were considered and individual actions address matters specific to the education and training sector Ensuring access to an equitable system is a driving force throughout the Department s work A Programme for a Partnership Government Commitments Under the Programme for A Partnership Government the Department has a range of commitments some of which involve collaboration with other Government Departments and state agencies These have been taken into account and are reflected in the actions outlined in this document Additional commitments arising from Cabinet Committee decisions and overarching budgetary and policy frameworks will also be considered as they arise strat new print final qxp Layout Page ACTION PLAN FOR EDUCATION Our Strategies A number of key national education and training strategies underpin our work and drive the significant changes that are being planned and implemented across the continuum of education Our whole of system approach enables us to integrate these strategies and monitor their progress as they

significant role in helping Ireland weather the exceptional economic crash They will be central to our ambitions as a nation economic cultural scientific and social over the coming years They will allow us to lead in innovation They will help us to achieve social inclusion Our central vision is that through adopting a whole of system approach the Irish education and training system should become the best in Europe delivering to the highest international standards equipping learners of all ages to participate and succeed in a changing world allowing Ireland be a leader across a broad range of endeavours and harnessing education and training to break down barriers for groups at risk of exclusion This is a realistic ambition as Ireland already ranks highly in international

and personal development enables learners to fully participate in school and prepares them e ectively for active and responsible citizenship and the world of work The e ectiveness of new policies and programmes to better equip young people will be benchmarked against best practice elsewhere Through the Early Childhood Care and Education ECCE scheme we have succeeded in making participation in pre school education and care much more accessible This is an area where we shall work with the Department of Children and Youth A airs to deliver a high quality learning experience Over of four year olds are enrolled in education in either preschools or infant classes in primary schools However only of Irish year olds are enrolled in ECCE provision while on average over of this age cohort are in early childhood education and care in other EU and OECD countries We also know that there is scope for improvement in the quality of provision within the ECCE scheme can vary At primary level Irish students scored significantly above the international average in reading and maths in benchmarks in PIRLS Progress in International Reading and Literacy Study and TIMSS Trends in International Maths and Science Study carried out in although performance in maths was well below that of students in the top performing countries While also above international averages Ireland s primary level science performance is further behind that of other countries compared to reading and maths At second level in the latest round of PISA Programme for International Student Assessment Irish students have performed well in reading digital and print maths and science However further improvements are required in maths and science to match the best performers internationally There is a wide range of subject choice in Ireland reflecting a broad based curriculum but there are areas where we need to widen and deepen the choices and mastery of key competencies A particular focus will be placed on developing greater diversity and take up of foreign languages There will also be a focus on increasing take up of gateway subjects including Chemistry Physics and ICT with coding at primary level and strong curricula right through second level further education and training and higher education Retention rates at second level have improved significantly in recent years and early school leaving is low by European standards We also compare favourably with other EU countries in terms of progression in higher education with of full time undergraduate new entrants in progressed to their second year of study in However progression rates do vary across the sector and between disciplines and further work will be done to see how students can best be supported to continue on their course or transfer to another programme In seeking to deliver the best possible learning experience for students in all its dimensions we shall actively benchmark ourselves against best practice overseas and seek to continually adapt our approach to incorporate successful methods that will work in the Irish context strat new print final qxp Layout Page ACTION PLAN FOR EDUCATION Goal OUR OBJECTIVES ACTIONS Enhance wellbeing in our school communities Fostering the personal development health and wellbeing of learners and the wider school community helps to ensure that our children and young people develop resilience have respect for diversity learn to create and maintain supportive relationships and become active and responsible citizens in society Schools will be assisted in embedding wellbeing guidelines A mandatory area of learning entitled Wellbeing will be introduced in Junior Cycle in The National Educational Psychological Service NEPS will be expanded Delivering a Step Change in the development of critical skills knowledge and competences The National Skills Strategy recognises the role of all levels of education and training in developing critical skills knowledge and competences Implementation of this Strategy will include further development and rollout of the national curriculum framework for Early Years Aistear redevelopment of the primary school curriculum work on coding as part of the maths curriculum and the broader primary curriculum and the introduction of Education about Religions and Beliefs ERB and Ethics rollout of the new junior cycle new specifications for Leaving Certificate subjects and a review of senior cycle programmes and locational pathways in senior cycle Increase subject choice for students in senior cycle Increasing subject choice for students is important for student motivation and engagement and for ensuring curriculum development continues to respond to the changing needs of learners society and the economy We are developing new specifications for a range of subjects in order to enhance competencies developed and assessed including in STEM subjects and to increase student take up of these critical subjects Another significant development will be the work on developing a subject specification for Leaving Certificate computer science which will help to harness and develop student interest in this strategically important discipline It is both significant and appropriate that a new Leaving Certificate Politics and Society syllabus will commence roll out this Autumn in the centenary year of the Easter Rising Improve transitions in order to support children and young people Research shows that it is important to support children and young people as they make transitions between levels of the education and training system As part of the implementation of this Strategy there will be significant developments to improve the transition between pre school and primary schools with more information being provided to parents on their childrens achievements and progress We will also see the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement awarded to the first cohort of students in a major milestone in the rollout of the new Framework for Junior Cycle A new grading system and common points scheme will be implemented from as part of improvements to the transition from second level to higher education Further work continues on the broader Transitions Reform agenda One of the key areas being examined is to broaden undergraduate entry The aim is to reduce the number of undergraduate entry routes while maintaining the number of student places to the minimum number necessary for academically appropriate and e icient allocation of places to applicants This had been signalled not only as a means to reduce the complexity of choice for second level students and the level of competitiveness driving the system but also as an opportunity to o er a much broader experience for undergraduates with specialisation to follow later in their degree These developments align with the modernisation of undergraduate curricula and assessment that is underway in institutions across the higher education system strat new print final qxp Layout Page goal o Increase the use of ICT in teaching learning and assessment A key objective of this Strategy is to create a step change in the use of ICT in teaching learning and assessment at all levels of the education and training system so that learners are equipped with the skills to live in an increasingly digitally connected world Actions include investment in infrastructure including high speed broadband for primary schools professional development for teachers and lecturers increased technology enhanced and blended learning opportunities Improve the development of language competence Being able to communicate e ectively through reading listening writing and speaking are fundamental life skills and there will be a particular focus on increasing competence in languages through the implementation of this Strategy and Action Plan In particular the implementation of revised curricula at primary level and the rollout of the Foreign Languages in Education Strategy will support increased levels of participation and competence in language learning Many of these themes are further explored under Goal Goal

educational disadvantage or learners with special educational needs Inclusive education is a fundamental principle of our education and training system and Ireland has had measures in place to support the diverse needs of students of all ages for many years While we have made considerable progress in advancing equity and equality of opportunity this Strategy recognises that significant challenges remain if we are to ensure that children and young people from di erent backgrounds are adequately supported so that they can experience success in the education system Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools DEIS Our main policy initiative to combat educational disadvantage DEIS is currently under review and we are seeking to incorporate best practice into a new programme There has been a significant improvement in the number of students in DEIS schools who have remained in school until their Leaving Certificate examination This proportion has grown from ten years ago to for those students who began second level school in The retention rate for non DEIS schools is Literacy and numeracy outcomes have improved in DEIS schools however achievement data shows that outcomes are below the national norm Participation and Access As part of the EU Strategy Ireland aimed to reduce the percentage of year olds with secondary education and not in further education and training to This target has now been exceeded with a current rate of There are few relevant international benchmarks for participation or retention in Further Education and Training type programmes Improving the quality and relevance of provision across the Further Education and Training sector will continue to be a key priority in the coming years and will be informed by best practice elsewhere Pathways to progression will be examined to ensure that they are fit for purpose and serving those who need them actions in Goal are relevant in this regard Overall participation by students with special educational needs in higher education has grown from less than students in to nearly in The new access plan contains a number of targets for specific categories of students that are currently under represented including students from lower socio economic groupings students with special educational needs mature students and members of the Travelling community Improving access by under represented groups was referred to in the report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education and the Department is also considering these findings in its work on access In this way progress to higher education should become more representative of the population in general Learners with Special Educational Needs Our approach to special education has undergone a huge transformation with a growing proportion of children with special educational needs being educated with their peers in mainstream schools The National Council for Special Education NCSE leads on research in this important area of policy and has recently advised that in terms of the model for supporting children with special educational needs international research points to the conclusion that there is no perfect approach that works in any country strat new print final qxp Layout Page ACTION PLAN FOR EDUCATION In developing advice the NCSE takes account of practice and provision in other countries and seeks to ensure that the best practices in other countries are captured to ensure that Ireland continues to be among the leaders in terms of provision and quality In the NCSE provided a report recommending a new model for the allocation of resources for children with SEN in mainstream schools The report promotes the proposed new model as a better and more equitable way recognising that no other country has found the best way Work on implementing this new model is now underway The Department s psychological service NEPS while supporting the development of the academic social and emotional competence of all students prioritises its support for students at risk of educational disadvantage and those with special educational needs Goal OUR OBJECTIVES ACTIONS Improve learning experience learning outcomes and progression for those at risk of educational disadvantage The Department will publish and implement a new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion which will include a school support programme an assessment framework for resource allocation and a monitoring and evaluation framework We will expand the range of education and training programmes to better meet the needs of key target groups including the unemployed and early school leavers We will improve access to education opportunities by ensuring that the targeted supports in place for students in higher education are fit for purpose and we will increase financial supports for post graduate students focusing on those from low income households Support learners with special educational needs to participate and progress We will improve the participation including participation in inclusive mainstream settings and progress of children with special educational needs across the whole education system and develop better whole school approaches We will develop and pilot a new model for the allocation of teaching resources to support children with special educational needs in schools A new Inclusion Support Service for

factor in sustaining and enhancing the quality of education outcomes in our system Teachers lecturers and educational practitioners deliver education services to meet the very diverse needs of learners parents and their local communities We know that providing the best possible professional development and ongoing practical support to these key people in the education sector is vital if we are to realise the ambitious objectives that we have for Irish education We recognise that the provision of high quality professional development opportunities for early years practitioners is needed to improve the quality of the learning experience for our youngest learners in the coming years We will work closely with the Department of Children and Youth A airs to improve initial and continuing professional development opportunities in this important sector Ireland is fortunate to attract high calibre people to the teaching professions and our teaching workforce has a strong reputation internationally We will increase investment in the professional development of teachers across the continuum from initial teacher education induction and early professional development through to advanced or expert teacher and leader as resources allow A key theme of the ongoing reform of teacher professional development will be to develop the collegial responsibility of the teacher not only as an expert teacher but also a participant in the collegial work of the school in improving standards in developing innovations and in assessing monitoring and improving students learning Increasingly high performing education systems make strategic investment in the capacity of their educational leaders We want to do that in Ireland also In the coming years new innovative programmes to support the professional development of school leaders will commence This will provide for professional coaching services and the introduction of a postgraduate qualification for aspiring school leaders We also recognise that having high calibre teachers and practitioners and highly e ective leaders will mean that our education and training providers can become learning organisations that are continually monitoring evolving and learning from best practice through evaluation benchmarking and continuous improvement based on best international practice This is true across the spectrum of education and training from pre school to further and lifelong learning At third level for example the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education mobilises expertise and inputs from across the HE sector to extend and shape best practice Really e ective learning organisations learn from self reflection and self evaluation and we know too that robust external evaluation combined with expert advice can help support innovation and high standards of learning in schools and other settings We will develop school self evaluation and ensure that the Departments Inspectorate s complementary programme of inspections and advisory visits help to support innovative and e ective practice in schools and early years settings while at the same time providing adequate quality assurance for parents and the public We need to promote innovation and excellence recognise high achievement and seek to mainstream successful approaches The implementation of this Strategy and Action Plan will focus on n Developing leadership capacity n Strengthening teaching and learning n Promoting innovation and peer learning and peer exchange n Delivering world class initial teacher education and in service training n Developing support services to help providers at all levels to successfully implement improvement plans n Supportive evaluation and quality assurance systems We will work in collaboration with national stakeholders and international experts in the field strat new print final qxp Layout Page goal Goal OUR OBJECTIVES AND ACTIONS Develop the continuum of teacher education Workforce planning will be strengthened with improved planning of teacher supply Teacher education and induction will continue to be reformed to support excellence and peer learning and peer exchange School leadership supports will be expanded with a new mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals and a professional coaching service for serving principals to support principals per year A new post graduate qualification will be rolled out for aspiring school leaders supporting teachers as lifelong learners Improvements will be made to leadership and middle management in schools to increase leadership capacity and make best use of resources Continuous professional development will be transformed with the creation of a centre of excellence to support in school improvement peer learning and peer exchange Improve quality promote innovation excellence and increase autonomy in schools Continuous improvement in schools will be supported through a new quality framework for external inspection and school self improvement A planned programme of external evaluation will be rolled out across the schools sector with a range of new inspection models All of these models will be focussed on inspection for improvement they will identify existing strengths in schools they will challenge schools to reach the standards set out in Looking at Our School the new quality framework for schools and they will provide sound advice for improvement Specialised inspection models will include a model focusing on ensuring the quality of education for learners with special education needs Inspection reports will be published on a rolling basis and made more accessible for parents and the public Increase quality of learning in early years The Department will support the Department of Children and Youth A airs to improve the quality of early years provision The implementation of Aistear S olta the early years curricular and quality frameworks will be supported with training for mentors and trainers and upskilling of the workforce A growing programme of early years education focussed inspections will be used to highlight and strengthen best practice to identify where improvements in provision are needed and to provide a reassurance of quality in educational provision in preschools in the ECCE scheme Promote high quality learning experiences in further education and training and higher education Implementation of professional development frameworks across the further education and training and higher education sectors is a key priority to ensure that teachers and lecturers continue to develop the right skills to support learners A Programme Learner Support Service will provide data on outcomes and course impact across the further education and training sector and support planning and prioritisation of course provision A rigorous programme of evaluation is also being rolled out for the first time

Ireland seeks to achieve strategic leadership in many chosen fields the quality of the connections between our education and training providers and the wider community will be a formative influence Our success in this respect will contribute significantly to our ambition to have the best education and training system in Europe Ireland is changing and the choices and expectations of citizens are changing with it Our education service must be able to respond to these new expectations While in the past educationalists may have been wary that the narrow repetitive tasks of the workplace should not crowd out the broader agenda of education now the demands of the workplace are increasingly focussing on the very characteristics education nurtures critical thinking creativity innovation adaptability collaboration Learners gain experience from placement in real world settings while organisations and enterprises public and private enhance their capacity to innovate and embrace new insights and technologies through interaction with education Compared to most of Europe we already have significant strengths with high levels of higher education attainment among the population particularly the younger cohorts Ireland ranks thout of the OECD for proportion of the working age population with a third level education data in Ireland compared to OECD average The EU average was However this varies significantly with age A lower proportion of year olds and year olds have attained tertiary education than the OECD average The proportion of those who attained tertiary education was high among year olds in Ireland where at Ireland was above the OECD average of or EU at In Ireland had the second highest percentage of students in tertiary education studying science maths and computing in the EU However our system of traineeship and apprenticeship has not developed to match many of the systems across Europe and requires a continued focus in the coming years in order to provide an attractive alternative to higher education progression routes The development of the new National Skills Council and Regional Skills Fora will provide a new focus nationally and regionally for the delivery of skills needs In Ireland ranked thout of the EU in lifelong learning at which is calculated as the percentage of persons who received education or training in the past four weeks the EU average was While we are not yet an Innovation Leader in Europe we stand out as one of the most e ective countries in converting our investment in scientific research into practical impact However we need to continue to improve the take up of STEM disciplines particularly among women levels of research activity and measuring impact Innovation Ireland s strategy for research and development science and technology sets out a vision for Ireland to become a global innovation leader driving a strong sustainable high employment economy and better society Innovation sets the agenda for cross departmental actions to realise the potential of research and innovation A number of agencies provide competitive research funding to the higher education sector including Science Foundation Ireland Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Research Council Even though the economic crash dealt a severe blow to entrepreneurship in Ireland The recovery has shown a very healthy revival and a strong desire within the education and training system to nurture entrepreneurial thinking Our ambition is to become an Innovation Leader in Europe and to develop stronger entrepreneurship in education to

facilitate amalgamations where desirable Enhance our capacity to meet national and regional skills needs Following on from the publication of the National Skills Strategy we will establish the National Skills Council and drive the development of the regional skills fora two key infrastructure developments to address skills needs nationally and regionally We will gather data from employers and graduates to evaluate performance outcomes and inform policy and programme development We will develop an ambitious Systems Performance Framework for Higher Education for the period to Annual Service Plans for further education and training will be based on quality outputs and performance targets A new ICT Skills Action Plan will be developed and published by the end of Create a greater diversity of opportunity in learning beyond school Working with employers we will strengthen apprenticeship and traineeship in Ireland increasing the range of courses and increasing the number of student places to achieve the Government targets of over apprenticeship schemes and apprenticeship and traineeship registrations by We will work with further education and training and higher education providers to provide a broader range of flexible opportunities for learners and to support an increase in lifelong learning As unemployment falls we need to shift our focus to developing the skills of those who are in work focussing particularly on those with lower skills This will create opportunities for second chance learners to up skill and re skill The distribution of money from the
