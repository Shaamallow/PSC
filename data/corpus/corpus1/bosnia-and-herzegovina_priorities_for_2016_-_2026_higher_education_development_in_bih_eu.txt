EU CoE project titled Strategic Development of Higher Education and Qualification Standards funded by IPA was carried out in Bosnia and Herzegovina One of its fundamental objectives was to define priorities for higher education development in BiH after i e the year in which the Strategic Directions for Education Development in BiH with Implementation Plan for Official Gazette of BiH No expires projecting full accession of BiH to the European Higher Education Area Good governance and management are reflected in a stimulative and effective framework of policies strategies legislation improvement of quality assurance mechanisms in higher education and research Resources as a precondition to the functioning and development of higher education have been targeted and covered as a topic by many reform projects implemented so far resulting in a common analysis higher education in BiH is inadequately funded and ranks low in the list of priorities Qualification standards stem from the requirement to produce a qualification framework for BiH harmonised with the European Framework for national qualifications to be recognised in all countries which joined the Bologna Process not only the EU Member States and foreign qualifications to be recognised in BiH The current BiH statistics on higher education cannot meet the demands of European statistical agencies It is beyond a doubt that higher education has the potential to significantly contribute to BiH s progress to the improvement of economic development democratic culture and general quality of life With the whole hearted engagement of the Project Advisory Group comprising representatives of all public and a few private universities recommendations have been translated into Higher Education Development Priorities in BiH These priorities are grouped in seven key areas describing the institutions responsible for and participating in the activities as well as the implementation time period This document provides a comprehensive overview of activities to be implemented in order to strengthen the development of higher education in BiH Society as a whole has an interest in the successful development of this sector Therefore the Project Advisory Group has pointed out that all parties are responsible for taking actions to find solutions to the problems which BiH higher education encounters This implies greater and good quality cooperation of many higher education actors which would establish a joint vision for the development of this sector in BiH and progress for BiH in its integration into the European Higher Education Area BiH HIGHER EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES P Good governance and management P Resources P Connection between the labour market and higher education
