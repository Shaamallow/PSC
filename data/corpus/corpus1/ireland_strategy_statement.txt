STATEMENT OF STRATEGY A Changing Environment for Education Economic and Social Environment It is recognised and accepted that education is a critical driver of economic success and social progress in modern society There is a growing recognition particularly in the European Union that the provision of quality education and training is central to the creation of a high skills knowledge and innovation based economy that will underpin ongoing and sustainable prosperity Education and training are also crucial to achieving the objective of an inclusive society where all citizens have the opportunity and the incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country Central to our future economic and social success is the development of quality and inclusiveness in education This must be seen as part of a strategy to support lifelong learning with the aim of improving knowledge and skills and promoting personal fulfillment The attainment of these objectives and goals will require that we ensure access progression and completion and the achievement of high standards for all learners irrespective of their background Supporting Government Policy Education is a key priority for the Government This Strategy Statement has been drawn up taking into account the education objectives of Government policy as outlined in the Agreed Programme for Government concluded in June In addition the goals and objectives outlined in this document are designed to contribute to a range of policies developed by the Government to address issues of national strategic importance These include the National Development Plan Sustaining Progress the National Anti Poverty Strategy the National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion the National Children s Strategy the National Health Strategy the Information Society Strategy the National Spatial Strategy and the Asia Strategy The National Anti Poverty Strategy is under review and a revised National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion will come into effect in A further policy context is provided by the European Union in particular by the Lisbon Strategy which seeks to make the European Union the most dynamic and competitive knowledge based economy in the world by capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion EU Education Ministers have agreed a work programme to achieve the Lisbon objective in the education and training areas Related policy guidelines for Member States are provided by the Copenhagen and Bologna declarations regarding vocational education and higher education respectively as well as the EU Council Resolution on Lifelong Learning The implementation of these strategies requires the input and support of a range of Government Departments and agencies A number of interdepartmental structures have been put in place to ensure a coordinated approach to the delivery of these strategies The Department of Education and Science contributes to the implementation of Government policy through its involvement in these structures and the delivery of key services The Department s contribution in this regard is detailed throughout the Strategy Statement and in particular in Chapter Department of Education and Science Statement of Strategy Meeting the Challenge of Change in Education Looking ahead a number of major challenges and trends in Ireland and elsewhere will necessitate ongoing adaptation and renewal of provision for education and education structures These challenges and trends will include The personal and social roles of learning The role of education and learning in promoting values of tolerance civic participation and social cohesion as well as personal and economic goals Growing awareness of the importance of families and communities in providing encouragement and the right settings for effective learning Growing awareness of equality and inclusion issues and in particular educational disadvantage Meeting the diverse educational needs of an increasingly multicultural society Increased emphasis on individual learning needs as well as values of self expression and individual rights and responsibilities Increases in retention at second level in the light of NAPS targets Supporting a knowledge and innovation based society and lifelong learning Increased emphasis on a much wider range of competencies and personal qualities particularly flexibility teamwork and communication in a rapidly changing economic and social environment The development and implementation of school self evaluation and external evaluation so as to improve standards in schools Appropriate updating of the school curriculum The development of quality early childhood education Providing the motivation to learn and learning to learn at all stages of formal education and beyond school The urgent need for investment in science and research to support a knowledge and innovation based society essential to our economic competitiveness and continuing prosperity Greater choice and flexibility in learning opportunities and pathways New opportunities for learning at all levels through developments in information and communications technologies Changing social economic and labour market circumstances Meeting the needs of a modern economy and society through more responsive flexible and innovative public services Demand for a wide range of skills at all levels especially skills in growth areas such as information and communications technologies and in the services sector More women in the labour force requiring different training responses greater job flexibility childcare and educational opportunities A Changing Environment for Education Impact of demographic change Increasing enrolment at primary level reflecting steady and consistent increases in births since the mid s Continuing net inward migration Pressure for provision of schools in rapidly growing areas and greater concern about regional balance particularly in the context of the Government s National Spatial Strategy Increasing demand for Third Level places as well as intake of part time mature and overseas students The changing teaching environment The changing face of delivery of education including changes in the practice and profession of teaching to reflect today s information age The role of the teacher is less focused on the provision of knowledge and more concerned with the teaching of learning skills The changing environment requires ongoing training support and development Changing legal circumstances and demands The evolving legislative framework for the delivery of education in Ireland Increased awareness of the legal rights and responsibilities of all those involved in education The need to work towards common policies in matters identified for co operation under the North South Ministerial Council as well as increased co operation at a European level The nature of Government responses to crosscutting issues Greater recognition that many issues of national importance require a coordinated response from Government Departments or agencies A broader context for co operation Greater awareness of cultural diversity and the roles of Irish and other cultures and languages in promoting identity in a European and international context Greater personal mobility and transfer of ideas knowledge and education services across State boundaries A substantial immigrant population and returning emigrants providing opportunities for greater diversity and enrichment of education and a requirement to make provision for the specific needs of these groups Enhanced co operation at EU level particularly in the context of the concrete future objectives of education and training systems Enhanced North South and British Irish dialogue and co operation on education in the context of the Good Friday Agreement Department of Education and Science Statement of Strategy Critical Success Factors The achievement of the goals and the successful implementation of the strategies outlined in this Statement are dependent on a number of critical success factors In particular the availability of resources the capacity of our organisation to deliver and a climate of co operation among those involved in education are essential elements in delivering a quality education for all Resources Success in delivering on the Department s mission requires a level of financial and human resources sufficient to meet the scale and complexity of a changing education system In particular the commitment of teachers and other staff to the provision of a first rate education system has been a key factor in the success of the system to date and will continue to be essential in the future The availability of an adequate level of financial resources is clearly a key success factor in delivering all existing and future services required to fulfil the mission of the Department The development of new research and evaluation processes and financial control and management systems will enable us to better manage and control existing resources and to prioritise funding to meet the areas of greatest need The June Agreed Programme for Government outlines a number of areas in the education sector targeted for development Priorities for investment in the medium term are highlighted in the National Development Plan which identifies education as a priority Sustaining Progress highlights the importance of education in addressing a number of social and economic issues Organisation Capacity As a Department we are at an advanced stage in the implementation of an extensive programme of restructuring and transformation The setup of the State Examinations Commission the establishment of a National Council for Special Education and the Regional office network will see the Department better placed to focus on its core functions This programme of reform will continue into the future with the on going alignment of processes at first and second level and with the introduction of web based technology to replace our traditional paper based systems Partnership The partners in education parents teachers patrons trustees governors management bodies the community and the State because of their constitutional legal and moral rights and responsibilities are involved in both policy development and in the provision of education services Their continued involvement at all levels in the Department and right across the sector is vital to fulfilling the needs of learners and to the progress of education in Ireland In particular the participation of the education partners and of other groups and individuals such as the social partners in the development of the partnership approach with the Department and associated bodies is critical to the achievement of our key goals and objectives The Department promotes partnership in policy development at both national and local levels This concept was given a statutory basis in the Education Act It is through genuine partnership that education policy development and implementation are strengthened and the commitment of stakeholders in the education sector is secured More generally in addition to the mutually beneficial North South and East West relationships underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement the growing importance of education and training on the European Union agenda and increased co operation with education authorities and institutions outside the State have enhanced the capacity of Irish education in terms of funding knowledge and innovation and contribute to the objective of Ireland being recognised as a centre of educational excellence A Changing Environment for Education Chapter Meeting the needs of the Individual High Level Goal We will deliver an education that is relevant to individuals personal social cultural and economic needs STATEMENT OF STRATEGY Meeting the needs of the

Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion the Senior Officials Group the Steering Group for Sustaining Progress the National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion the National Drugs Strategy the County Development Boards RAPID and a number of other cross sectoral forums including the statutory Educational Disadvantage Committee dealing with specific aspects of social inclusion The Department has reviewed its educational disadvantage programmes with a view to building on what has been achieved to date adopting a more systematic targeted and integrated approach and strengthening the capacity of the system to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged children and young people The review process built on earlier work carried out by the Educational Disadvantage Committee and the action plan for educational inclusion DEIS launched by the Minister in May takes account of the need for cross sectoral and inter Departmental integration and partnership working Special Educational Needs The provision of appropriate education services to children and adults with special educational needs crucially involves close co operation and co ordination of activities between education and health authorities The Health Services Executive HSE has a key role in providing support services such as the delivery of various therapies and others with disabilities often attend HSE funded day care services or reside in HSE funded facilities The implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act will enhance co ordination in this area and will require enhanced co operation between the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children and relevant bodies in their remit Child Protection The Report of the Working Group on Garda Vetting which was submitted in March recommended that prospective full time employees part time employees volunteers and students on placement who would have substantial unsupervised access to children and or

moves and those remaining in Dublin This arises because a substantial level of staff transfers between departments and other agencies will take place at every stage of implementation The successful delivery of the programme within the timescales envisaged will require close co operation between departments to ensure that the potential for disruption to the delivery of State services arising from staff changeover is minimised Through its membership of the Decentralisation Liaison Officers Group the Department will contribute to the development of policy at central level in relation to decentralisation and to the resolution of general difficulties arising from implementation Contributing to Cross Departmental Strategies Chapter A Changing Organisation STATEMENT OF STRATEGY A Changing Organisation Changing our Focus The Department is in the final stages of completing a major structural reform programme which has seen the establishment of a State Examinations Commission SEC a National Council for Special Education NCSE and a network of Regional Offices The setup of the SEC has enabled the Department to move away from detailed involvement in operational matters and to focus on policy development forward planning and evaluation The structured transfer of functions from the Department to the NCSE will allow the Department to concentrate on planning future policy to ensure that resource allocation results in appropriate educational services being available for all children A key objective is to strengthen the management of knowledge to enable more effective policy formulation We are committed to making better use of existing evidence and research both national and international to support policy development and decision making This will also involve proactive and systematic identification of information needs and management of information flows in a way that applies knowledge of best practice to practical policy issues In particular we will Strengthen and develop our policy making structures in order to anticipate and plan for medium and long term educational needs Ensure that policy formulation will be undertaken in a consistent and coherent manner both within the Department and across the education system Develop a medium term strategic plan for education research and development that reflects policy priorities Locate analyse and disseminate research relevant to best practice and innovation at all stages of learning Develop structures for the promotion and development of education research Enhancing our Service Provision

directed at providing a wide range of services on a day to day basis Over the period of this Strategy Statement and during the process of change outlined above the Department will continue to maintain and enhance its provision of these services so that they are provided in the most effective efficient timely and high quality manner possible Our customer service strategy is outlined in Chapter

and local levels to improve co ordination and integration of related Government policies Our contribution to cross departmental strategies is detailed in Chapter Department of Education and Science Statement of Strategy Strengthening our Analytical Capacity The Department is committed to developing a stronger planning capacity including the analysis of statistics and indicators of performance of Irish education in both a national and an international context to underpin national policy formation In particular the Department will strengthen its capacity to formulate effective and innovative policy options in relation to major social demographic and economic trends Better Financial Management The additional demands being made on the Department arising from the increased level of public expenditure on education and the need for improved financial management information to support the strategic management process require the further development of the Department s integrated financial management system This will facilitate the full costing of programmes and will incorporate indicators and other information relating to the achievement of our objectives and as a result secure better value for money Developing our most Important Resource The successful implementation of organisational change and of the strategies outlined in this statement are critically dependent on the commitment knowledge skills and competencies of the staff of the Department The recruitment and deployment of an adequate number of staff the provision of relevant training and the management of PMDS are key objectives of our HR Strategy We will also improve and expand training and development options for staff to meet identified needs at all levels and to assist the integration of new staff into
