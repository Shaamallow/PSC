CHANGING SKILLS AND POTENTIAL LABOUR MARKET CONTENTS PAGE PAGE PAGE EDUCATION AND OBJECTIVES AND IMPLEMENTATION AND TRAINING IN ACTIONS MEASURING SUCCESS IRELAND NSS Report v a s Layout Page IRELAND S NATIONAL SKILLS STRATEGY IRELAND S NATIONAL SKILLS STRATEGY FOREWORD Increasingly Ireland is competing globally on the basis of talent and on Ireland s growing reputation for innovation Winning the war for talent can be achieved by ensuring that all of Ireland s citizens have access to the skills they need to succeed in life and Irish business has the people with the skills they need to grow This is also critical to securing our recovery and ensuring Ireland s people share in that recovery This Government has focused on economic recovery and job creation Firstly by stabilising the public finances to create the conditions for economic stability and return to growth and then by driving job creation through the Action Plan for Jobs process That strategy and the hard work and sacrifices of the Irish people have delivered an astonishing recovery Ireland is now in full recovery mode and within striking distance of full employment As we approach full employment making sure Irish workers have the skills that enterprise needs matters more than ever If we are to secure the recovery and future proof the Irish economy we need to put in place a long term skills strategy to ensure all of our people can reach their full potential and play an active role in building a better Ireland The only constant in life is change and that means we need a strategy which is flexible enough to respond to a rapidly changing environment This Strategy forms an integral part of the Government s long term economic plan to restore full employment and build a sustainable economy It is closely aligned with broader Government policy including Enterprise Pathways to work and the Action Plan for Jobs Indeed given the importance of the skills agenda to the Government s overall economic plan it is no exaggeration to say that this strategy forms the keystone of Ireland s strategy to deliver long term sustainable growth This strategy sets an ambitious trajectory for the next ten years for skills development in Ireland It marks an important step in the evolution of Ireland s education system to a system which fully supports lifelong learning and is more responsive than ever to the changing needs of participants enterprise and the community We can continue and enhance the reform of our system of education and training with a real partnership between the education sector and enterprise to provide the mix of skills needed over the next ten years and beyond This FOREWORD strategy puts in place the structures to enable that partnership The establishment of Regional Skills Fora will enable employers to have their say in what skills mix will best serve their region into the future At national level the new National Skills Council will utilise intelligence on skills requirements to proactively address emerging skills gaps We will use regular rigorous evaluation of activities to constantly improve the quality of provision at all levels and drive key reform initiatives already in train for example in early childhood education school curriculum reform and Skills have become the global currency of the st century development of Apprenticeships Without proper investment in skills people languish on the margins of society technological progress does not Ireland is a small country we cannot afford untapped talent nor do we intend to leave any of our people locked out of participating in the workforce through a lack of skills That is why there is a specific focus in this strategy on active translate into economic growth and countries can no inclusion for the economically marginalised longer compete in an increasingly knowledge based global society We can t deliver Government s ambitious jobs targets without bringing our emigrants home Migrants will be encouraged to return to Ireland to take up skilled positions and there will be increased mobility of early stage researchers coming through Ireland s higher education system into industry OECD Secretary General Angel Gurr a Job creation remains the focus of this Government because as the Taoiseach said recently a job doesn t just mean an income A job can transform a life Give a person a role and a stake A job offers the chance to make a contribution It helps young people in particular find their own path in life and strike out to a new future This strategy will deliver the skills to generate jobs and sustainable economic growth and help Ireland and its people strike out to a new and better future Jan O Sullivan TD Damien English Minister for Education and Skills Minister for

recovered from an e unemployment high of at the end of to less than today As we move into recovery j skills shortages are now emerging in certain areas and occupations for instance in advanced manufacturing and Information Communications Technology ICT Global trends and drivers of b change such as changing consumption patterns and shifting power structures are shaping international markets and emerging enterprise sectors Technology is one of the key drivers of o change and improved digital skills will be vital for Ireland s future both in higher end dedicated ICT jobs and more widely as a basic core competence Other core or transversal skills like languages and entrepreneurship will also underpin Ireland s use of its talent offering as a global Objectives differentiator Education and training providers will place a stronger focus on providing skills development opportunities that are relevant to the needs of learners society and the economy Ireland s young population with the highest proportion in the EU under is another strong potential competitive advantage Of our million people of working age almost are Employers will participate actively in the development of skills and make effective use of economically inactive and supporting this section of the population to participate in and contribute skills in their organisations to improve productivity and competitiveness to the skills needs of the labour market is one of this Strategy s objectives Another objective will be to increase the supply of skills by for example encouraging Irish migrants to return home a move The quality of teaching and learning at all stages of education will be continually enhanced that will enrich Ireland both economically and societally and to support older workers to remain in and evaluated employment Increasing people s lifelong learning especially of those in employment is a national performance gap that this Strategy will tackle People across Ireland will engage more in lifelong learning The youthfulness of our population while a clear potential international advantage also poses There will be a specific focus on active inclusion to support participation in education and challenges to Ireland s education and training system Over the last decade full time enrolments training and the labour market have increased by more than and they will continue to rise in the coming years These demographic pressures notwithstanding important reforms are underway across all elements of We will support an increase in the supply of skills to the labour market the education

intelligence will underpin the Strategy s implementation and inform resourcing allocations Prioritisation of skills needs will be overseen by the new National Skills Council The new Regional Skills Fora will facilitate ongoing employer educator dialogue to match identified needs with sustainable provision in each region thereby optimising the return on Irish investment in education and training Initiatives will be monitored by existing mechanisms and regular impact evaluations These will be complemented through the tracking of identified key national and international skills indicators The cumulative intent is to ensure that Ireland s people develop and use their skills to their maximum potential through sustainable employment and civic participation Employers in Ireland both private and public will recognise their staff as their key asset Others both companies and skilled individuals will be attracted to Ireland because of its global reputation for the priority that we attach to education and its role in a person s dignity development and contribution to prosperity Snapshot from the consultation papers received we need to create an environment where ideas flourish not to produce drones with skills Our graduates must have a strong emphasis on creativity and flexibility ideas and thinking outside the box Flexibility is key to encouraging participation in lifelong learning as for many it needs to take place around the working day there is still a significant gap in the provision of high quality courses that are suitable for those in employment Companies are now focused on training which will not only increase the company edge but will enable the learner to achieve a greater understanding of themselves increasing their appetite to excel Individuals Worker
