The Ministry sets out the details of the evaluation of pupils educational outcomes in a regulation dealing with its implementation Acquisition of a level of education and completion of basic education Acquisition of a level of education and completion of basic education are governed by and respectively Part C The Concept and Objectives of Basic Education The concept of basic education Basic education is the continuation of pre school education and follows up education in the family Basic education is the only stage of education that the whole population of pupils goes through on a compulsory basis It is organized in two stages that are mutually linked in terms of content and organization Basic education at Stage is conceived so as to facilitate pupils transition from pre school education and family care to compulsory regular and systematic education patterns It is based on learning things while respecting and developing each individual pupil s needs skills and interests including pupils with special educational needs Owing to its activity driven practical nature using appropriate methods education motivates pupils to continue learning leads them to a learning activity and to finding that it is possible to seek discover create and find suitable ways of solving problems Basic education at Stage helps pupils to acquire knowledge skills and habits that will enable them to study independently and to create such values and attitudes as lead to prudent and cultivated behaviour to responsible decision making and to respect for the rights and obligations of citizens of both their country and the European Union The scope and principle of Stage basic education build on a wide development of pupils interests on pupils higher level learning potential and on the mutual linking between education and school life on the one hand and out of school life on the other hand This makes it possible to use rather demanding working methods as well as new sources and methods of learning to assign the pupils comprehensive and long term tasks or projects and entrust them with quite a lot of responsibility in learning as well as in organizing school life Both Stage and Stage of basic education require a stimulating and creative environment that provides incentives to the most gifted and skilled pupils encourages the less talented pupils and protects and supports the weakest students and is so adjusted that each child through education adapted to his or her individual needs will develop optimally in line with his or her own predispositions for learning To this end adequate conditions are also created for the education of pupils with special educational needs A friendly and helpful atmosphere encourages pupils to learn work and foster activities that suit their interests and provides them with space and time for active learning and for a full development of their personality Assessment of pupils performance and achievements should be based on the fulfilment of specific and practicable tasks on the evaluation of the pupil s individual development and on a capacity to make finely tuned positive judgements The pupils must be given the opportunity to enjoy success not to be afraid of mistakes and instead to work through them During their basic education pupils gradually acquire such personal qualities as will enable them to continue their studies acquire additional skills in their profession of choice and continue their life long learning and to a degree matching their potential to actively participate in the life of the community and society Objectives of basic education Basic education should help pupils to form shape and gradually develop their key competencies and provide them with the dependable fundamentals of general education mainly aimed at situations that are close to their real life and at practical behaviour Efforts are therefore made in basic education to meet the following goals Create preconditions for pupils to acquire basic learning strategies and motivate them to life long learning Stimulate and encourage pupils to creative thinking logical reasoning and problem solving Get pupils to engage in efficient effective open communication on all aspects of their life Develop pupils abilities to cooperate and to value their own work and achievements as well as the work and achievements of others Guide pupils so that they should become free and responsible individuals who exercise their rights and meet their obligations Induce in pupils the urge to express positive feelings and emotions in their behaviour ways of acting and when experiencing important situations in their lives develop in them sensitivity and responsiveness towards other people the environment and nature Teach pupils to actively develop and protect their physical mental and social health and to be responsible for it Guide pupils to tolerance and consideration for other people to a respect for their culture and spiritual values teach pupils to live together with others Help pupils to discover and develop their own abilities and skills in the context of actual opportunities and to use their abilities and skills in combination with their acquired knowledge when making decisions regarding the aims of their own life and profession Key Competencies Key competencies represent the system of knowledge skills abilities attitudes and values that are important to the individual s personal development and to the individual s role in society The selection and concept of key competencies are based on values that are generally accepted by society and on generally shared ideas as to which competencies of the individual contribute to his or her education welfare and success in life and to a strengthening of the functions of civil society The reason for and aim of education is to provide all pupils with a set of key competencies at a level they are able to attain and in this manner to prepare them for their further education and their role in society Acquiring key competencies is a long lasting and complex process which starts during pre school education continues during basic and secondary education and takes its definite shape during subsequent life While the level of key competencies that the pupils have attained when finishing their basic education should not be regarded as the final level the key competencies acquired form an important basis for the pupil s life long learning and his or her start in practical living and the labour market Key competencies are no isolated phenomena they are mutually linked and intertwined multifunctional have a cross subject nature and can only be acquired as a result of a comprehensive education process Therefore their forming shaping and development must be the ultimate aim of the complete educational content and of all of the activities taking place at school The content of the education framework for basic education understands the subject matter of teaching as a means to master activity oriented expected outcomes which are gradually combined and create preconditions for an efficient and comprehensive use of acquired abilities and skills at the level of key competencies The following competencies are regarded as key competencies at the basic education stage learning competencies problem solving competencies communication

Information and Communication Technologies Information and Communication Technologies Humans and their World Humans and their World Humans and Society History Civic education Humans and Nature Physics Chemistry Nature Geography Arts and Culture Music Fine Art Humans and Health Health Education Physical Education Humans and the World of Work The World of Work Each educational area is defined by an introductory description of the educational area which describes the position and relevance of the educational area within the basic education system and describes the content of each of the educational fields included in the educational area Furthermore the links between the educational contents of basic education at Stage and Stage are highlighted The description is followed by the aims of the educational area This section describes what the pupils are guided to by the educational content so as to gradually acquire the key competencies Practical interlinking between the educational content and the key competencies is provided by the fact that based on the aims of the educational area the school defines within the school education programme its educational strategy for the subjects taught see Diagram The educational content of the educational fields including the complementary educational fields comprises the expected outcomes and the subject matter Within Stage the educational content is additionally divided into Period grades to and Period grades and This division is meant to help schools distribute the educational content among the grades Expected outcomes are activity driven practically aimed usable in common life and verifiable They define the expected competency in applying acquired knowledge in practical situations and in common life The education framework of basic education identifies the expected outcomes at the end of grade Period as tentative i e not binding and at the end of grade Period and grade as binding The subject matter is structured within the education framework of basic education into thematic areas themes activities and is supposed to be a means to achieve the expected outcomes Due to its informative and formative function it is an integral part of the educational content Curriculum defined within the education framework of basic education is recommended to schools for distribution and further detailing for the individual grades or longer time segments At the level of the school education programme the curriculum is binding The school will divide the educational content of each of the educational fields into subjects and will detail and where appropriate add subject matter to the curriculum with respect to the pupils needs interests inclination and talents so that the development of the key competencies be best pursued An educational field can comprise either one subject or more than one subject also a subject can integrate the educational contents of more than one educational field The education framework of basic education allows for interlinking integration of the educational content at the level of themes Complementary educational fields complement and widen the educational content of basic education The educational content for mentally disabled pupils is defined by a separate Annex to the Framework Education Programme for Basic Education thematic areas or educational fields Integration of the educational content must respect the logic of the structure of the educational fields involved A qualified and skilled teacher is a basic precondition for functional integration The system is conceived so as to achieve a situation where the teachers would cooperate when setting up the school education programmes interlink suitable themes which are common to the individual

Direction followed to form shape and develop pupils key competencies LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION THROUGH LANGUAGE Description of the educational area The educational area Language and Communication Through Language holds a pivotal position in the educational process A good level of language culture is one of the major indicators of the general achievement of the basic school graduate Language education provides pupils with the knowledge and skills that allow them to understand various kinds of messages to express themselves appropriately and to apply the results of their learning The content of the educational area Language and Communication Through Language is implemented in the educational fields of Czech Language and Literature Foreign Language and Another Foreign Language The skills acquired in the educational field Czech Language and Literature are necessary not only for good quality language education but also for the successful acquisition of knowledge in other areas of education The use of Czech as a mother tongue both in the oral and written form allows pupils to familiarize themselves with and understand the socio cultural development of human society This educational field provides the foundations of effective inter personal communication as the pupils learn to interpret their responses and feelings so as to understand their role in various situations and to identify with their perception of the surrounding world and themselves The content of the educational field Czech Language and Literature is of a comprehensive nature For easier understanding it is divided into three components Communication and Composition Language and Literary Education Nevertheless instruction interweaves the contents of these three components In Communication and Composition pupils learn to perceive and understand various language messages to read with comprehension to write in a cultivated manner to speak and to make decisions based on different texts related to diverse situations that they have read or listened to to analyse the text and to critically evaluate its content At higher grade levels pupils learn to assess the formal qualities of the text and its structure In Language pupils acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to learn the standard form of the Czech language and learn to recognise and identify its other forms The Language component guides pupils towards accurate and logical thinking which is a prerequisite for expressing oneself clearly comprehensibly and in a well structured manner In developing the necessary knowledge and skills pupils general intellectual skills are used and deepened as well including the ability to compare various phenomena identify common and different features classify them while applying various perspectives and arrive at a general conclusion The Czech language thus becomes not only the instrument for the acquisition of a majority of information but also a subject of cognition In Literary Education pupils familiarize themselves by means of reading with basic literary styles and learn to perceive their specific features to identify the artistic intentions of the author and to articulate their own opinions about the work they have read They also learn to distinguish literary fiction from reality They gradually acquire and develop basic reading habits and the capacity for creative reflection upon and the interpretation and production of a literary text Pupils arrive at findings and experiences that may positively influence their attitudes and values and enrich their spiritual life Verbal as well as non verbal communication can also be developed by means of Drama Education which is included in the FEP BE as a complementary educational field Until Another Foreign Language is defined as a complementary educational field and allocated lessons in Stage This means that the school must offer Another Foreign Language to all pupils as an optional subject The educational content of the complementary educational field Another Foreign Language is set out in chapter Foreign Language and Another Foreign Language contribute to understanding and discovering facts that go beyond the experience facilitated by the mother tongue These fields provide a vivid language basis and the pre conditions for the pupils ability to communicate within an integrated Europe and the rest of the world Foreign language skills help reduce language barriers and increase the individual s mobility in their personal lives and during their future educational and career paths They allow pupils to learn about the different lifestyles and cultural traditions of people in foreign countries Moreover they promote an awareness of the importance of mutual international understanding and tolerance and create the conditions for schools participation in international projects The requirements for foreign language education set out in the FEP BE are based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages which describes the various levels of language proficiency Education in the educational field of Foreign Language leads to the acquisition of the A level and education in the educational field of Another Foreign Language aims to achieve level A according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages The success of language education as a whole depends not only on educational achievement in the mother tongue and in foreign languages but also on the extent to which pupils language culture becomes the concern of all other areas of basic education Aims of the educational area Instruction in this educational area focuses on the formation and development of key competencies by guiding pupils towards cid understanding language as an independent historical

other topics It focuses on the past as well as the present and leads towards the acquisition of skills for practical life Through its broadly conceived synthesized integrated content this educational area participates in forming mandatory basic education at Stage Education in the area of Humans and Their World develops the knowledge skills and initial experience which pupils have acquired in their families and during pre school education Pupils learn to observe and name things and phenomena their interrelationships and contexts and thus acquire their first coherent picture of the world They learn about themselves and their immediate surroundings and gradually become familiar with physically and chronologically more removed persons and phenomena and more complex events They learn to understand people and their interrelationships and to notice observe and contemplate substantial factual and aesthetic features of human works and natural phenomena Based on their understanding of themselves their needs and the world around them the pupils learn to perceive principal social relations to understand the current way of life with its strengths and weaknesses and to see the present as the result of the past and a starting point for the future When acquiring the knowledge and skills contained in the educational area of Humans and Their World pupils learn to express their thoughts observations and impressions and to respond to the ideas opinions and suggestions of others Successful education in this area is conditioned upon pupils own experience of specific or model situations when acquiring the necessary skills and approaches The teacher s personal example contributes significantly to making this possible Linking this educational area with real life situations and with pupils practical experience greatly helps pupils handle new situations and new roles and helps them find their position among peers and strengthen their work and social habits In this way the educational area provides the foundations for more specialised instruction in the educational areas of Humans and Society and Humans and Nature and the educational field of Health Education The educational content of the educational area Humans and Their World is divided into five thematic areas By combining these thematic areas within the SEP it is possible to create various alternative subjects and educational contents In the thematic area The Place Where We Live pupils based on familiarising themselves with their immediate surroundings learn about relationships and contexts and understand the organisation of life in the family at school in the community and in society They learn to participate actively in daily life with their own ideas to pursue new and interesting things and to move safely around this world Emphasis is placed on traffic education practical knowledge of local and regional reality and on developing pupils personal experience Diverse activities and tasks should naturally encourage pupils to form a positive relationship with the place where they live gradually develop their national consciousness and form a positive relationship to our country In the thematic area People Around Us pupils gradually acquire and reinforce the basics of proper manners and behaviour towards other people They gradually realize the importance and essence of tolerance assistance mutual respect and solidarity among people including gender equality They learn how people come together enjoy themselves and create culture They learn about basic rights and responsibilities but also about problems related to the coexistence of people entire It is traditionally possible to create one subject in grades i e to select subject matter from various thematic areas to match the expected outputs for Period and two subjects in grades i e to use thematic areas and as a foundation for National Geography and History and areas and for Science It is also possible to create only one subject in grades and or one subject throughout grades to It is not always necessary to stick strictly to the thematic areas The subject matter can be structured combined or distributed in various ways so as to meet the expected outcomes societies or even the world global problems The entire thematic area thus focuses on providing the initial knowledge and skills required by future citizens of a democratic country The thematic area People and Time facilitates an understanding of events and time Pupils learn how and why time is measured and how events proceed in time and create the history of things and events They learn how life and things develop and what changes they are subjected to over time This thematic area begins with the most familiar events in the family community and region and proceeds towards the most important moments in the history of our country The essence of the thematic area is to encourage pupils to take an interest in history and the cultural wealth of the region and the entire country It is therefore important that pupils can independently search for obtain and explore information from available sources particularly from members of their family and people around them so that they can jointly visit historical sights regional and specialised museums public libraries etc In the thematic area Diversity of Nature pupils learn about the Earth as a planet in the solar system where life was created and has been evolving They get acquainted with the extensive diversity and variability of animate and inanimate nature in our country They are guided to realize that the Earth and life on it constitute one integral entity where all major actions exist in harmony and balance which people can easily disturb and restore only with difficulties Based on practical exploration of the countryside and other information pupils learn to seek out evidence of changes in nature and to identify ways in which they at their age can contribute to environmental protection and sustainable development In the thematic area People and Their Health pupils focus on exploring themselves as living human beings with specific biological and physiological functions and needs They learn how human beings develop and change from birth to adulthood and what is good and what is bad for them in terms of daily regime hygiene nutrition interpersonal relationships etc They acquire basic knowledge of health and diseases health prevention and first aid and safe conduct in various life situations including emergency situations

a range of topics associated with the study of nature It provided pupils with the tools and methods for a deeper understanding of natural phenomena and natural laws It also gives them the necessary foundation for a better understanding and use of contemporary technology and helps them better orient themselves in everyday life In this educational area pupils receive an opportunity to get to know nature as a system whose constituent parts are interconnected and interrelated and mutually influence one another Based on this knowledge pupils realize the importance of maintaining the natural balance of existing living systems including humans The educational area also significantly promotes the creation of open thinking open to alternative viewpoints critical thinking and logical consideration Through their activities and the research character of instruction the educational fields of the educational area of Humans and Nature Physics Chemistry Nature and Geography allow pupils to more deeply understand the laws of natural processes and thus to become aware of the usefulness of being familiar with the natural sciences and applying this knowledge in everyday life Especially important is the fact that while studying nature through the help of specific learning methods pupils also learn important skills These include the ability to systematically objectively and reliably observe experiment and measure to make and test hypotheses regarding the essence of observed natural phenomena to analyse the results of their verifications and on this basis to draw conclusions Pupils thus learn to study the causes of natural processes and their interrelations or interconnections to ask questions how why what will happen if and to seek to answer them to explain observed phenomena to seek out and solve cognitive or practical problems and to use their knowledge of the laws of natural processes in order to predict or influence them In the aforementioned educational fields pupils gradually familiarise themselves with the complexity and diversity of the real world and with the fundamental interrelationship between the state of nature and human activity above all our dependence on natural resources and the influence of human activities on the state of the environment and human health They learn to study changes occurring in nature to discover the causes and effects of changes to important local and worldwide ecosystems and to consciously use their scientific knowledge in order to protect the natural environment and promote the principles of sustainable

Human health is understood as a balanced state of physical emotional and social well being It is created and influenced by many different factors including lifestyle healthy conduct interpersonal relationships the environment and the individual s safety and security Because health is a fundamental condition for leading an active and satisfied life and for optimum work productivity learning about one s health and promoting health and prevention represent a priority of basic education The educational area of Humans and Health introduces pupils to fundamental information for influencing one s health knowledge activities behaviour and teaches them in the use and application of this information in daily life The primary aim of education in this educational area is for pupils to become acquainted with themselves as living beings and to understand the importance of good health and prevention and to learn about issues associated with illnesses or other health impairments Pupils familiarize themselves with various threats to health which they may come across in common and less common situations learn skills and behaviour decision making for preserving or strengthening their state of health and gain the required level of responsibility for their own health and the health of others Much attention is thus focused on learning fundamental life values the gradual formation of attitudes towards life and acting in accord with these attitudes At the level of basic education these objectives must be founded on effective motivation and on activities and situations which will increase pupils interest in this topic Implementation of this educational area should emphasize practical skills and their application in model situations and in daily school life It is thus extremely important that life at the school be in accord with the things pupils are learning in relation to health and their health related needs At the outset instruction must be strongly influenced by the teacher s positive personal example and multifaceted support and an overall positive atmosphere at the school Later the emphasis shifts on pupils greater independence and responsibility for their behaviour in decision making and health related activities Education presented with these principles in mind forms the basis for forming the pupils active approach to promoting and protecting their health The educational area of Humans and Health is defined and implemented in an age appropriate manner through the educational fields of Health Education and Physical Education which also includes physical health education The educational content of Humans and Health is interwoven with the life of the school and with other educational areas which add to or make use of apply this area The educational field of Health Education provides pupils with fundamental information on the human body as related to preventative health measures Pupils learn to actively promote and protect health in all its forms social emotional and physical and to be responsible for their own state of health In its educational content this field is closely linked to the educational area of Humans and Their World Pupils reinforce their hygienic nutritional work and other preventative healthcare habits expand their ability to refuse harmful drugs avoid injuries and deal with personal threats in everyday and less common situations They expand and deepen their knowledge of family school peer group nature humans and interpersonal relationships and learn to see their activities through the prism of the health related needs and prospects of a growing young individual and to make decisions beneficial to their health In view of the individual and social dimension of health the educational field of Health Education is closely linked with the cross curricular subject of Personal and Social Education As part of pupils comprehensive education in health related issues the educational field of Physical Education focuses on becoming acquainted with one s personal abilities for and interests in physical activity and with the impacts of certain physical activities on physical fitness and emotional and social well being Physical education starts with spontaneous physical activity and moves on to guided and elective activities aimed at giving pupils the ability to independently judge their level of physical fitness and to include physical activity into their daily routine in order to satisfy their personal needs for and interests in physical activity to promote the optimum development of fitness and performance to recuperate strength and compensate for various forms of stress and to promote health and health protection One precondition for developing good exercise habits is that at the level of basic education pupils experience physical activities and communication during exercise properly learned skills reinforce the quality of the experience Physical education is characterized by the recognition and development of talents and subsequently different activities for pupils and different evaluations of their performance It is particularly important to discern pupils physical weaknesses and to correct these through joint and individual forms of physical education both through mandatory physical education as well as if necessary through physical health education For this reason an inseparable part of physical education are corrective and special balancing exercises applied preventively during physical education for all pupils as needed or assigned to pupils with physical weakness in place of activities which are counterindicative of their weakness At the same time schools are recommended to offset the physical deficits of pupils in health category III in special cases category II and to provide corrective exercises by assigning a mandatory or elective subject whose activities are taken from the thematic area of Physical Health Education as a satisfactory replacement for mandatory physical education or for expanding the range of physical exercises This range of exercises takes into account the state of modern society which in many ways has made our life easier but paradoxically has led to numerous health impairments at a young age which must be rectified and corrected lack of intensive and proper physical activity long periods of time spent in sedentary positions excessive food intake and poor nutrition poor air quality frequent stressful situations negative social relations etc Basic education thus responds to the findings of doctors that health impairments are on the rise in the entire population and that children with health impairments require a greater amount of spontaneous and targeted physical activities than healthy children Participation in physical health education helps pupils familiarize themselves with their health impairments and the level and extent to which they are limited in certain activities At the same time it offers specific ways of influencing one s impairment special exercises targeted physical activities relaxation techniques swimming etc and of including them into the pupils daily routine Aims of the educational area Instruction in this educational area focuses on the formation and development of key competencies by guiding pupils towards cid recognizing health as

Cross curricular subjects in the FEP BE are subjects related to contemporary present day issues and represent an important and inseparable part of basic education They represent an important formative element of basic education offering pupils the opportunity for individual engagement and teamwork and promotes their personal development primarily as concerns attitudes and values All cross curricular subjects are organized in the same manner They include characteristics of the cross curricular subject which emphasize the cross curricular subject s importance and position in basic education This is followed by a description of its relationship to the educational areas and the benefits of the cross curricular subject for pupils personal development pupils knowledge skills and abilities as well as their attitudes and values The recommended contents of the cross curricular subjects for basic education are divided into thematic areas marked in bold Each thematic area contains an available range of themes activities ideas The selection of themes and the manner in which they are worked into the syllabi is up to the individual schools The cross curricular subject s thematic areas cover multiple educational areas and allow for the integration of content from the educational fields This contributes to the pupils comprehensive education and positively influences the formation and development of their key competencies Pupils are thus given the opportunity to form an integrated view on a given issue and to apply a broad spectrum of their skills Cross curricular subjects represent a mandatory part of basic education Schools must include all cross curricular subjects contained in the FEP BE into stages and of education Not all cross curricular subjects however must be represented at each grade level It is the school s responsibility to over the course of basic education gradually offer pupils all thematic areas contained in the individual cross curricular subjects their extent and manner of implementation is governed by the SEP Cross curricular subjects may be used as an integrated part of the educational content of a subject of instruction in the form of individual subjects projects seminars courses etc In order for the cross curricular subjects to be effective they must be integrated with the educational contents of specific subjects of instruction and with the contents of the pupil s other activities at school and outside of school The following cross curricular subjects have been defined for basic education cid Personal and Social Education cid Democratic Citizenship cid Thinking within European and Global Contexts cid Multicultural Education cid Environmental Education cid Media Education PERSONAL AND SOCIAL EDUCATION Characteristics of the cross curricular subject Six year grammar schools must include into their educational content the entire cross curricular subject of Democratic Citizenship from the FEP BE which is not contained in the FEP GE as well as all cross curricular subjects from the FEP GE They may include the other cross curricular subjects from the FEP BE if they consider this to be useful for the school s educational objectives At their lower stage eight year grammar schools must include all cross curricular subjects from the FEP BE into the educational content Of these they must include all of the cross curricular subject of Democratic Citizenship from the other cross curricular subjects of the FEP BE the school must include at least certain thematic areas in order to prepare pupils for the thematic areas of the cross curricular subjects contained in the FEP GE At the level of basic education the cross curricular subject Personal and Social Education emphasizes formative elements focuses on subject and object is practically oriented and finds daily application in life It reflects the pupils personalities and their individual needs and unique traits Its purpose is to help all pupils form practical life skills A specific characteristic of Personal and Social Education is the fact that the subject of instruction is the pupils themselves as well as the particular group of pupils and situations which they may encounter more or less frequently in everyday life Its purpose is to help all pupils find their own path towards satisfaction in life a path founded on a good relationship with oneself with others and with the world The relationship between personal and social education and the educational area of Language and Communication through Language is founded on the communicational essence of language the focus is on daily verbal communication as a key instrument in various life situations It deepens the relationship between verbal and non verbal communication and expands the specific use of language to include social skills The educational area of Humans and Their World can be complemented using themes aimed at self awareness healthy self esteem self regulation and maintaining mental health good mental health habits communication interpersonal relationships There is also a close relationship to the educational area of Humans and Society specifically Civil Education and Humans in Society People as Individuals in particular the themes of human encounters relationships among people principles of human co existence Humans in Society and similarity and diversity of people the inner world of people personal development People as Individuals In Personal and Social Education all these topics are viewed as being independent Personal and Social Education places an emphasis on gaining practical skills connected with the these topics The relationship to the educational area of Humans and Nature concerns the evolution of human behaviour animal and human communication and self regulatory behaviour as fundamental ecological principles It also offers the possibility for developing emotional relationships personal attitudes and practical skills in relation to the natural environment The relationship to the educational area of Arts and Culture concerns primarily the common focus on developing sensory perception creativity and the perception and formation of a non artistic aesthetic e g the aesthetics of behaviour and interpersonal relationships and an understanding of art as a tool for communication and exploring the world In personal and social education we may effectively apply various approaches of drama education The fundamental methods of Drama Education are the tools of drama and stage work personal and social education additionally uses non theatre socio psychological training methods Personal and Social Education may be integrated with the educational area of Humans and Health via suitable topics reflecting an individual s physical aspects social relations communication and decision making in normal and tense situations Personal and Social Education can thus help pupils gain

focused on personal social and moral development For implementation we recommend including those topics which reflect pupils actual needs or which are chosen on the basis of mutual agreement with them All topics described here are realized through practical means using appropriate games exercises model situation and relevant discussion In view of the fact that these are lively encounters which touch on personal and existential issues teachers should anticipate that pupils will have different opinions on different things that they may reject a topic or technique that they will be inhibited or that certain games will not work out Precisely these kinds of moments tend to be of high value in Personal and Social Education since they offer an opportunity for thinking about what is going on

speaking it represents a synthesis of the values of justice tolerance and responsibility while more specifically helping to develop critical thinking an awareness of one s rights and responsibilities and an understanding of the democratic social order and democratic approaches to problem solving and conflict resolution The objective of Democratic Citizenship is to equip pupils with a basic level of citizenship literacy the ability to orient oneself in difficult situations problems and conflicts found in an open democratic and pluralistic society In gaining these skills pupils learn to solve problems constructively while retaining their human dignity and respect for others while bearing in mind the interests of society as a whole and with a full awareness of their rights and obligations freedoms and responsibilities while applying fundamental rules of proper communication and democratic problem solving At the level of basic education this cross curricular subject is presented not only through thematic areas but also through the skills and experiences of the pupils themselves where the overall school atmosphere the relationships between all individuals involved in the educational process are founded on cooperation partnership dialogue and respect creates a democratic atmosphere in the classroom In this laboratory of democracy pupils will be more motivated to share their opinions in group discussions and to participate in democratic decision making community and society At the same time they not only personally understand the importance of observing rules or participating in the creation of new rules in the interest of justice but also realize the importance of working to strengthen democracy against the continued threat of falling into anarchy or despotism This experience then helps to develop critical thinking skills The cross curricular subject of Democratic Citizenship is closely linked to the educational area of Humans and Society which addresses the principles of democracy democratic decision making democratic governance and human and civil rights with an emphasis on individual and citizen participation in the social and political life of democratic societies The educational area of Humans and Their World is incorporated in areas focusing on home and home country The cross curricular subject is also linked to other educational

basic education may be adapted and altered for these pupils in order to bring the educational requirements in line with the pupils actual abilities For the same reason it is possible to set a different length for the teaching hour The SEP includes special education subjects and subjects of special educational care corresponding to the pupils special educational needs resulting from the type of health disability and physical disadvantage This includes speech therapy sign language spatial orientation and independent movement for visually impaired pupils visual stimulation work with optical aides reading and writing in Braille physical health education communication and social skills etc At the same time the SEP describes which compensational and educational tools special textbooks and educational programmes are used during teaching When diagnosing special educational needs and assessing the abilities of pupils with health disabilities and physical disadvantages as well as during their education upon approval from parents or legal guardians additional support may be provided by educational care centres officially of Act no of Decree no registered school counselling facilities educational psychological counselling special educational centres etc and specialised school counselling staff in particular special education teacher or psychologist Conditions for teaching pupils with health disabilities and physical disadvantages Planning and implementation of the educational process should be based on a specific diagnosis and description of the pupil s special educational needs and abilities Although each category of pupils with health disabilities and physical disadvantages shares common educational needs and requires the same type of special educational support it should be kept in mind that pupils are individuals with varying educational needs and abilities For this reason subjects of special educational care are taught while observing the principle of the individualization and differentiation of education The successful education of pupils with health disabilities and physical disadvantages requires the following observe health aspects and respect the pupil s individuality and needs enable the use of all supporting measures during the pupil s education apply the principle of the differentiation and individualization of the educational process when organizing activities and determining educational content forms and methods provide specialists for teaching subjects of special educational care respect the type degree and level of disability or disadvantage when assessing the outcomes of teaching remove architectural barriers and perform any necessary changes to or adaptations of the school environment work together with the pupil s parents or legal guardians school counselling facilities and specialised school counselling staff or with specialists from other areas in particular when preparing individual education plans work together with other schools which educate pupils with health disabilities or physical disadvantages promote pupils gifts and talent by providing the appropriate educational offer Other conditions for teaching pupils with health disabilities provide a higher time allotment at all grade levels for those subjects which require additional time because of the pupils disabilities enable the application of the maximum weekly time allotment established by the Education Act for each grade level in order to include subjects of special educational care adapt and formulate the expected outcomes for the educational fields in the individual periods in order to make them realistic and attainable for these pupils in light of their abilities and adjust the selection of subject matter to these outcomes if the pupil s pupils health disability objectively prevents the realization of the educational content of all or part of an educational field contained in the FEP BE enable the replacement of all or part of the relevant educational content in the SEP with related or different educational content which is better suited for his their educational abilities see notes on the FCT make use of alternative forms of communication sign language Braille other forms of communication if needed and in accord with currently binding legal regulations allow an assistant teacher in the classroom or study group of Decree no of Act no If the pupil attends school for ten years stage is divided into period grades and period grades Teaching socially disadvantaged pupils This group includes pupils from social or linguistic backgrounds which are different from that in which the majority population is growing up These pupils either belong to a local minority or are the children of immigrants primarily refugees and asylum seekers In Czech schools the number of such pupils is on the rise Some such pupils are able to integrate into regular schools without serious problems while others may encounter various difficulties of a linguistic nature or because they are deeply influenced by their families and cultural patterns which are reflected in behaviour actions and different values lifestyles concepts of childrearing relationship to education etc Pupils from families with low socio cultural and economic standing are more frequently at risk of socio pathological influences For these reasons it is necessary to devote specific attention to these pupils to the extent they require From the very beginning of their schooling in most cases the main problem in teaching pupils from a different cultural background is their lack of familiarity with the language of instruction This is symptomatic for the most minorities and ethnic groups for whom instruction does not take place in their mother tongue It is thus not only necessary to make sure that they learn the Czech language but also that they become familiar with Czech society and its cultural habits and traditions On the other hand it is necessary to ensure in accordance with the Education Act and under the conditions established therein that these pupils receive instruction in the language of the relevant national minority and are given the opportunity to receive information during their school career from which they may select elements in order to build their own identity This requires complementing the educational content to include specific materials on their nationality s history culture and traditions The school s long term objective must be the integration of pupils from different cultural and socially disadvantaged backgrounds the protection of their minority culture and the promotion of their success within the majority society It is thus vital that when preparing the SEP schools be aware of the nationality ethnicity or value system of all their pupils and to respond as flexibly as possible to their cultural differences or to prepare an individual education plan for these pupils which meets their needs to the maximum possible extent Conditions for teaching socially disadvantaged pupils The most important factor in successfully teaching pupils from culturally different and frequently also socially disadvantaged backgrounds is the teacher who should be familiar with his pupils and their family background be able to select an appropriate approach and to create a welcoming social atmosphere in the school and classroom The school must make use of instructional methods which are suitable for the pupils diverse learning styles and different ways of organizing instruction and to plan instruction on the basis of the interests experiences and needs of pupils from various cultural ethnic and social backgrounds The successful education of socially disadvantaged pupils requires the following individual or group attention preparatory classes the aid of an assistant teacher smaller number of pupils per classroom corresponding methods and forms of work specific textbooks and materials regular communication and feedback cooperation with a psychologist special education teacher child behavioural psychologist social worker or other specialists of Act no Creating the school education programme at basic schools attached to healthcare facilities children s diagnostic institutions and educational facilities established for institutional and protective education When creating the school education programme at basic schools attached to healthcare facilities children s diagnostic institutions and educational facilities established for the institutional and protective education of children requiring medical treatment as a result of neurological damage and mental illness see to of Decree no regulating the details of institutional and protective education at educational facilities the director of the school or educational facility may adjust the school education programme or the organization of education as established in the FEP BE according to the facility s specific conditions and the pupils educational needs and abilities Teaching exceptionally gifted pupils The education of exceptionally gifted pupils is an important part of basic education because exceptionally gifted pupils have specific educational needs which need to be addressed and require the creation of suitable conditions Gifted is most commonly defined as possessing a collection of abilities which enable the individual to attain a higher level of achievement than the average population The number of exceptionally gifted pupils is estimated at to Exceptionally gifted pupils may be gifted in one or several different areas Basic education plays a fundamental role in identifying and developing exceptionally gifted pupils This is primarily due to the fact that all pupils pass through this stage of education and it is long enough for systematically observing pupils in order to identify those who are gifted to provide appropriate motivation to develop their gifts and to provide them with opportunities for applying their gifts in specific activities These pupils require specific attention and support from the school and family particularly stimulation and the creation of suitable pre conditions for developing their talent Identifying gifted pupils Identifying exceptionally gifted pupils is a long term process involving pedagogical psychological pedagogical psychological and lay techniques The main approach involves the observation of pupils during their school based work an analysis of pupils work outcomes and portfolios an assessment of tests and assignments and interviews with pupils and parents For pupils up to age it is especially difficult to determine unambiguously whether they are exceptionally gifted or whether we are seeing uneven faster development which will gradually level out to the standard for their age while remaining in the upper average When looking for exceptionally gifted pupils it is important to pay attention to pupils with developmental disorders affecting their learning or behaviour physically disabled pupils and pupils from different cultural backgrounds or from disadvantaged social backgrounds With the approval of the pupil s parents or legal guardians teachers may be aided in identifying gifted pupils and properly nurturing their gifts by psychologists from a network of pedagogical psychological counselling centres Specific characteristics of exceptionally gifted pupils cid the pupil s knowledge exceeds the required level cid problematic attitude towards the rules of schoolwork cid tend to create their own rules cid tendency towards perfectionism and a corresponding approach sometimes contentious to communication with the teacher cid personal working pace cid create their own approaches to solving assignments which allow for creativity cid little willingness to work together within the group cid quickly learn teaching approaches cid enjoy solving difficult assignments in particular in connection with a high level of ability in the subject physically gifted pupils tend to overestimate their abilities cid good concentration and memory tend to seek out and find creative approaches cid insight into their own learning cid increased level of motivation for a deeper approach to the basic subject matter especially in subjects of instructions in which the pupil is gifted Although the question of gift or talent has been studied for more than a hundred years there still exists no uniform defition of gifted or exceptionally gifted The estimated number of gifted pupils varies from author to author cid a need to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and skills in the school environment Formation of relationship networks among exceptionally gifted pupils Among exceptionally gifted pupils the formation of relationship networks is influenced by their personality in particular their strong inclination towards introversion Certain characteristics of these pupils personalities may also make it more difficult for them to form conflict free relationships with their peers teachers or themselves In particular their inclination towards perfectionism their heightened level of criticism towards themselves and the surrounding world and their specific sense of humour may influence the formation of relationships with their peers classmates For pupils who have not been provided with the tools for learning how to deal with their specific abilities their exceptional gifts may paradoxically cause them to form a negative self image and to reject their special abilities At other times it may occur that an unstimulating and unaccommodating environment causes such pupils to close themselves off into an inner world of their abilities and to refuse to communicate with the surrounding peer environment Since many gifted pupils are introverts with poor social skills who prefer limited communication with their surroundings or are more inclined to communicating with older people this is quite a common situation Another important factor is the level to which the pupils gifts correspond to the abilities and opportunities in their surroundings i e their family classroom teachers and peers When the pupils start going to school it is important for them to become members of an age based community even if they usually find it easier to communicate with adults or older schoolmates Gifted pupils frequently are afraid that they will not be able to integrate into their age based community As a result they tend to deny their own abilities when trying to integrate into their natural peer age group With increased age these pupils display an increased social awareness and are well aware of their virtues and insufficiencies as well as their standing within their peer group where their exceptional gifts may even become a reason for their peers admiration The formation of a positive climate for exceptionally gifted pupils requires a sufficient amount of sensitivity to the pupils specific needs on the part of those around them Possible adjustments to the form of instruction provided to exceptionally gifted pupils The form of instruction used with exceptionally gifted pupils should consistently observe the principles of individualization and internal differentiation Examples of pedagogical organizational adjustments cid individual education plans cid complementing expanding and deepening the educational content cid assigning specific assignments cid including pupils into independent and more extensive work and projects cid internal differentiation of pupils in certain subjects cid occassional temporary creation of groups for selected subjects with an open choice on the part of pupils cid for certain

school education programme The School Education Programme for Basic Education SEP is a school document which in accordance with the Education Act every school providing basic education must prepare on the basis of the FEP BE The SEP is based on the school s specific educational objectives and takes into account the pupils needs and abilities the school s real conditions and capabilities and the justified demands of the pupils parents or legal guardians It is prepared with a view towards the school s standing in the region as well as the social environment in which instruction will take place The educational process at each specific school takes place according to the SEP prepared by the school The school s director is responsible for preparing the SEP in accordance with the FEP BE He or she coordinates the work involved in creating the SEP or may assign the role of coordinator to a subordinate or other member of the teaching staff The actual preparation of the SEP reflects the school s pedagogical autonomy as well as its responsibility for educational methods and outcomes For this reason the individual parts of the SEP are prepared with the participation of all of the school s teachers who are co responsible for implementing the SEP in the conditions existing at their school The SEP is established published by the school director following negotiations with the school board which comments on both the SEP as well as on the provision of education according to this programme The SEP is a mandatory school document and must be publicly accessible so that all those interested may familiarise themselves with its programme content inspect it and make notes and excerpts or request a copy As part of its inspection activities the Czech Schools Inspectorate ascertains and assesses the manner in which the SEP is met and the extent to which it follows legal regulations and the FEP BE Fundamentals for preparing the school education programme for basic education the SEP
