the Status and Quality of Teachers the government has launched a series of measures to strengthen a modern school of knowledge Increased efforts on further and continuing education and school based development measures are some of the most important initiatives Even if it is crucial with good individual teachers it is not sufficient We also need school heads who are able to create environments for sharing of knowledge and collaboration and municipalities and counties aiming at good quality in their schools It is the interaction between good teachers school leaders and school owners which is the key to succeed This Government supports all schools to become learning organizations however the team building in itself has to take place locally Lower Secondary in Development is an important national measure both to contribute to this team building and to enhance the pupils basic skills School based competence development is a basic element in the Lower Secondary in Development This implies the fact that the school including the management and all the staff are taking part in the development processes at their own working place School becomes a learning organization where teachers and management are facing the challenges in common evaluate their own practice and execute changes and develop the education and training when necessary In this way a team is built in school to be for the best for the pupils Simultaneously we are continuing the historical emphasis on further and continuing education Never until now have there been so many study places for teachers who want more professional input The further and continuing education should be as close to the field of practice and contribute to increased knowledge and knowledge sharing in school Choice of subject areas for the school owners in the Lower secondary in Development should be related to the prioritization of subjects for further and continuing education We are well under way with the realization of the Lower Secondary Education in Development It started in and schools with lower secondary level classes shall have accomplished this measure by autumn The intention of this strategy is to be of help and support for teachers school leaders and school owners For a well organized school skillful management and a strong learning and professional fellowship are to the best for the learning and motivation among the pupils May Torbj rn R e Isaksen Minister of Education and Research Strategy for the lower secondary school Contents Introduction Objectives and indicators Objectives Development of indicators National support measures Introduction The measures are developed in cooperation with researchers in classroom management Norwegian Centre for Mathematics Education Support for school owners Support for teachers and school administrators Relationship to other priority measures The roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders Pupils Parents Teachers School administrators School owners University and university college HE sector Regional Gnist National authorities This strategy document explains the main elements in the prioritized initiatives and roles including the areas of responsibility of the different stakeholders Participating organizations in the Gnist partnership have rendered important contributions to this document The Gnist partnership nationally and internationally has been invited to partake in the further working out and completion of the measures in the strategy Strategy for the lower secondary school Introduction The Storting discussed White Paper Motivation Mastery Opportunities in January cf Recommendation to the Storting S The White Paper signalled further development of a diverse and inclusive school for everyone The key message is that a more practical varied relevant and challenging lower secondary school will raise student motivation and learning The Government is taking three main steps to promote this introduction of elective subjects increased flexibility through changes in allocation of lessons and subjects the measures within the framework of this strategy Statistics and research show that pupils motivation for learning is at its lowest in lower secondary school Many pupils find school dull and monotonous resulting in some pupils falling behind in the learning process and some of them never completing upper secondary school To find out why motivation is so low the Ministry of Education and Research has been engaged in dialogue with a large number of pupils teachers and parents in lower secondary school They have voiced their opinions on how the lower secondary school should be renewed There has been close cooperation with the various organisations engaged in making the lower secondary school better The conversations with and feedback from pupils teachers parents and others communicated a clear and strong desire to see more practical and varied working methods in the lower secondary school At the same time it is important that the education is perceived to be both relevant and challenging This can be an important contribution to raising pupils motivation and commitment Classroom management numeracy reading and writing are priority commitment areas to vary the working methods in the lower secondary school The key measures are school based professional training in classroom management numeracy reading and writing for teachers and school administrators development of descriptions of good classroom management and good teaching in numeracy writing and reading assistance in and facilitation of local development work network for exchanging experience and establishing a professional community National education authorities have received a challenge from international experts in the OECD and from national researchers We must communicate priority measures in education policy more clearly to all levels in the education system and explain better how the schools can reach the goals The expectations to the different partners and which tasks shall be handled by which stakeholders must also be clear to everyone The Ministry will send a proposal out for consultation in regard to changing the allocation of lessons and subjects to allow more local flexibility in the classroom schedule Topland B og E M Skaalvik Meninger fra klasserommet Analyse av Elevunders kelsen Kristiansand Oxford Research Strategy for the lower secondary school In order to succeed we must have trust and good communication across and between the management levels and the stakeholders in the school sector This strategy shall contribute to higher pupil motivation and learning outcome in the lower secondary school enhancing the desire to learn in general and raising skill levels in numeracy reading and writing in particular teachers making teaching more practical and varied through better class management and developing a culture for sharing reflection and cooperation at all schools with lower secondary school classes school administrators giving priority to educational leadership and contributing to developing the school as a learning organisation school owners giving priority to the selected areas in their planning and development work and actively supporting the schools work of raising the quality of education regional local networks coordinating and facilitating the priority efforts and contributing to exchanging experience and dialogue the university and university college sector HE contributing to school based skills development and to developing the knowledge basis and the pupils ability to provide practical and varied teaching national authorities preparing support and guidance material facilitating school based skills development and more cooperation The strategy applies for the five years from the start of the school year to The measures in the campaigns will be developed and subject to pilot tests in the period leading up to the school year The strategy measures will be fully in force as of the school year The objective is to reach all schools with lower secondary level duringthe strategy period Strategy for the lower secondary school Objectives and indicators Objectives The purpose of primary and secondary education in Norway as defined in Section of the Education Act emphasises that the education shall provide all children and young people with the knowledge attitudes and values that enable them to master their own lives and participate in society and in working life To follow up the lower secondary school the Government has emphasised the following paramount goals for primary and secondary education Everyone shall be included and experience mastery Everyone shall master basic skills Everyone shall complete upper secondary school By making education in the lower secondary school more practical and varied and strengthening the teaching of numeracy reading and writing pupils will achieve more experiences of mastery higher motivation and in general learn more Strengthening classroom management and the focus on numeracy reading and writing will benefit all pupils also those who do well in school The efforts must involve all subjects Motivation and mastery for better learning through more practical and varied education Teachers who are proficient in and use multiple teaching methods and who are open to cooperation and involving the pupils have pupils who achieve better results The teacher s ability to choose methods in accordance with the class room situation to make the content relevant for the pupils and to adapt the complexity to the pupil group and the individual pupil has great impact on whether the pupils learn what they should and experience mastery The teacher has a duty to lead the learning and development activities according to the mandate given in the Education Act with regulations Some methods may be better than others in certain situations and with some pupils but how pupils learn varies as must the choice of method Teachers must apply and trust their professional judgment in this work Teachers and school administrators are responsible for keeping professionally up to date and staying informed of research developments This knowledge combined with own practical experience and knowledge of the pupils must form the basis for the teachers and individual schools choice of education methods Use of more varied methods practical assignments and other teaching arenas place considerable demands on the teachers ability to lead the class through the different learning activities and to establish good relationships with the pupils Good classroom management is therefore particularly important in order to make the learning experience more practical and varied Nordenbo

Oslo Teknisk Rapport Dansk Clearinghouse for Uddannelsesforskning K benhavn Strategy for the lower secondary school Pupils need to be motivated to make the effort required in lower secondary school and to complete an education Varied working methods are important for motivation and will in many cases also involve practical working methods The pupils participation and a positive attitude to learning are important for the pupils motivation Schools and parents both have a significant impact on the pupils attitudes Pupils want challenges and they also want to see the relevance of what they learn in their own lives In order for pupils to understand why they must make an effort in their school work they must perceive the education as relevant and meaningful Reading and writing skills are important for the pupils learning in all subjects and to cope with working life and life in general as well as for developing their own identity and cultural knowledge The objective is for pupils who graduate from lower secondary school to be able to read quickly and efficiently and to understand different types of texts in all subjects and on both paper and screens Pupils must be able to use writing as a tool to develop their own thinking and learning and be able to formulate texts that are adapted to the content and purpose of the writing Numeracy skills are necessary to succeed in later education in working life and to master their own lives and personal economy The goal for pupils who graduate from lower secondary school is to be able to solve complex mathematical problems based on all subjects Both numeracy skills and reading and writing skills are necessary to understand current development in society and to play an active part in society This is why numeracy reading and writing have been emphasised as priority commitment areas in the strategy Development of indicators The formulation of clear objectives that can be followed up is a key precondition for successful implementation Everyone who works on the implementation of the measures has a need for information about the degree to which the objectives have been reached in their own area of responsibility The indicators will form the basis for following up the degree to which the objectives have been reached at all institutional levels that work with the strategy schools and municipalities regional and national level The indicators for the strategy will be discussed with the Gnist partners In accordance with White Paper Tid til l ring Time for Learning cf Recommendation to the Storting S it is assumed that the indicators will be based on available statistics and that the burden of reportingon teachers and school administrators will not increase The indicators will provide information on the pupils motivation and learning outcome In addition new indicators must be developed to provide some indication whether the schools have been successful in making the education both practical and varied There will also be a need for information on the implementation of the various measures in the strategy to adjust the content and design as the process proceeds For a more detailed description of basic reading arithmetic and writing skills see Rammeverk for grunnleggende ferdigheter Basic skills framework stipulated by the Ministry of Education and Research on January There is currently no suitable basis for writing indicators Strategy for the lower secondary school The indicators must provide information on whether pupils motivation increases whether the number of pupils with low basic skills in reading and numeracy decreases whether the number of pupils with high basic skills in reading and numeracy increases whether boys reading skills improve whether education becomes more practical and varied challenging and relevant implementation of the measures in the strategy Municipalities and county municipalities prepare an annual situation report for discussion in the municipal councils and county councils The report on the state of education must cover learning results drop out issues and learning environment The situation report can be used by the municipalities in following up the objectives of the strategy Section second subsection third and fourth sentence of the Education Act There is a similar rule in Section third subsection of the Private Schools Act relating to private schools Strategy for the lower secondary school National support measures Introduction The national measures are meant to be a supplement and support for the work performed in the schools and the municipalities The measures must support and stimulate the use of varied and practical working methods which should also be challenging and of relevance for the pupils The measures have a long term perspective and allow room for local adaptations and local initiative National measures do not replace local development work but aim to contribute to knowledge skills and guidance where needed This means that the measures must be flexible in order to be adapted to the priorities of the schools and school owners The measures are developed in cooperation with researchers in classroom management Norwegian Centre for Mathematics Education The Reading Centre the Writing Centre NAFO universities and university colleges The Directorate for Education and Training has established resource groups for the different priority areas to assist the national centres and researchers in the development of the measures The resource groups will contribute to important experiences from the practical implementation The Gnist partners have proposed participants for these resource groups Below is an overall description of the national support measures under the strategy Support for school owners The school owners are responsible for the quality of the training and for assessing and following up compliance with the requirements in the Education Act and the associated regulations The school owner s own initiative is important to ensure that the commitment areas have an effect in the classroom The measures in the strategy will contribute to support the school owners in their local development work Everyone can benefit from an external perspective on their own activities The work on the strategy aims for teachers school administrators and representatives of school owners to network both in and between schools and municipalities This can take place through existing networks or by establishing new networks Regional Gnist partnerships can contribute to support school owners directly or through networks and will be an arena for coordination and development of the measures in the individual county region Support for teachers and school administrators The most comprehensive measure to support teachers and school administrators is the offer of school based skills and competence development in classroom management numeracy reading and writing The development of skills will also provide room for working on assessment for learning The skills and competence development must be school based be directed towards the education of all pupils at lower secondary level be offered to all schools with lower secondary school level National centre for multi cultural education Cf Section second subsection of the Education Act and Section of the Regulations to the Education Act Strategy for the lower secondary school consist of varied subject programmes with different content and duration adapted to local needs include online resources available to all schools with lower secondary school level The measures must be based on experience and research on good practice The national centres and the research group for classroom management will prepare specific descriptions of good classroom management and good teaching of numeracy reading and writing and provide examples of how to make teaching more practical and varied The resource groups where the partners are represented will participate in this work The descriptions and support material included in the school based development of skills will serve as inspiration and practical support in the work to improve the lower secondary school Schools with a well functioning professional community seem to be more able to achieve good education for the pupils than schools where teachers work more individually It is important that school owners and school administrators facilitate room for teachers to reflect assess and discuss with colleagues pupils and others on how the training can become more practical and varied while remaining relevant and challenging for the pupils The development of skills will therefore include all personnel in the schools School based skills and competence development includes teachers working together and with external staff observing each other in practice cooperating to test new practices and considering whether this results in desired changes In order to implement skills and competence development in their own school school administrators must have the expertise to lead and implement development and change processes School administrators will participate in the school based development of skills and competence They will also be offered training in educational and in organisational development work It is a prerequisite that the school owners will play an active role in the strategy work and that they both support and hold school administrators accountable for their management of the school s quality development work and the teachers educational practices Relationship to other priority measures The Ny Giv New Possibilities effort is directed at reducing the number of drop outs from upper secondary school Ny Giv New Possibilities correlates well with the objectives of this strategy Elements from the Transition Project in Ny Giv New Possibilities will be continued in the school based skills and competence development within this strategy but will target all age groups and all pupils at the lower secondary level The expertise development in the transition project will continue as planned up to and including The campaigns Bedre l ringsmilj Better Learning Environment and Vurdering for l ring Assessment for Learning will be implemented as planned Elements from the campaigns will be integrated in the school based skills Stoll L Bolam R McMahon A Wallace M and Thomas S Professional learning communities a review of the literature Journal of Educational Change Strategy for the lower secondary school development in the lower secondary school The skills and competence development in this strategy will be coordinated with the strategy Competence for Quality Strategy of Continuing Education and Training The work on classroom management numeracy reading and writing will be organised to enable schools to build on earlier efforts Most schools with lower secondary school classes have in recent years been involved in various national campaigns to raise the quality of the pupils learning environment and numeracy reading and writing skills Many schools work actively to enhance quality and analyse the challenges they are facing for example through use of St stedsanalysen the Situation Analysis and Organisasjons analysen the Organisation Analysis Some schools have received support from the national Veilederkorpset Guidance Corps in their development processes or have participated in the school development programme the Knowledge Promotion Reform from words to action or the four year campaign Vurdering for l ring Assessment for Learning or have participated in SKUP skole and kommuneutviklingsprosjektet the School and Municipality Development Project The experiences from these change processes will be useful in the further strategy work The measures will be based on relevant resources and methodology from Ny Giv New Possibilities and The guidance corps The guidance corps can in cooperation with local support resources assist in identifying development needs and available resources and support the local development work Kompetanse for kvalitet strategi for etter og videreutdanning Kunnskapsl ftet fra ord til handling The guidance corps gives support to school owners and schools to in their work on quality improvement Strategy for the lower secondary school The roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders In order to achieve the goals classroom practices must improve There are many stakeholders that are responsible and must contribute in different ways to achieving a common objective of enhanced motivation and learning outcome for the pupils One important precondition for success is clarity as regards roles and responsibilities as well as a good dialogue between players at different levels in the sector Expectations for and responsibilities of key players are described below Pupils The pupils are a resource enhancing quality in the lower secondary school As they grow older pupils are gradually expected to take more responsibility for their own learning The pupils are expected to use the opportunity to participate in the governance of the school and communicate their expectations for the school contribute to achieving the objectives through committed work and participation contribute to the learning community Elevorganisasjonen
